A Mediterranean Dietary Intervention in Female Carriers of BRCA Mutations: Results from an Italian Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background: Women carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations face a high lifetime risk (penetrance) of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), body weight and markers of insulin resistance affect BRCA penetrance. We conducted a multicenter prospective two-armed (1:1) randomized controlled trial (NCT03066856) to investigate whether a Mediterranean dietary intervention with moderate protein restriction reduces IGF-I and other metabolic modulators of BRCA penetrance. Methods: BRCA carriers, with or without a previous cancer, aged 18–70 years and without metastases were randomly assigned to an active dietary intervention group (IG) or to a control group (CG). The primary endpoint of the intervention was the IGF-I reduction. Results: 416 women (216 in the IG and 200 in the CG) concluded the six-month dietary intervention. The IG showed significantly lowered serum levels of IGF-I (-11.3 ng/mL versus -1.3 ng/mL, p "
Deficit in Adipose Differentiation in Mesenchymal Stem Cells Derived from Chronic Rhinosinusitis Nasal Polyps Compared to Nasal Mucosal Tissue,"Chronic rhinosinusitis of the nasal mucosa is an inflammatory disease of paranasal sinuses, which causes rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and hyposmia, and in some cases, it can result in the development of nasal polyposis. Nasal polyps are benign lobular-shaped growths that project in the nasal cavities; they originate from inflammation in the paranasal mucous membrane and are associated with a high expression of interleukins (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IgE. Polyps derive from the epithelial–mesenchymal transition of the nasal epithelium resulting in a nasal tissue remodeling. Nasal polyps from three patients with chronic rhinosinusitis as well as control non-polyp nasal mucosa were used to isolate and cultivate mesenchymal stem cells characterized as CD73+, CD90+, CD105+/CD14-, CD34-, and CD45-. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) cultures were induced to differentiate toward adipocytes, where lipid droplets and adipocyte genes PPAR2, ADIPO-Q, and FABP4 were observed in control non-polyp nasal mucosa-derived mesenchymal cells but were scarcely present in the cultures derived from the nasal polyps, where apoptosis was evident. The modulation of the response to adipogenic stimulus in polyps represents a change in the molecular response that controls the cascade required for differentiation as well as possible means to specifically target these cells, sparing the normal mucosa of the nasal sinuses.

Characterization of -Glucosidase Inhibitors from Psychotria malayana Jack Leaves Extract Using LC-MS-Based Multivariate Data Analysis and In-Silico Molecular Docking,"Psychotria malayana Jack has traditionally been used to treat diabetes. Despite its potential, the scientific proof in relation to this plant is still lacking. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the -glucosidase inhibitors in P. malayana leaf extracts using a metabolomics approach and to elucidate the ligand–protein interactions through in silico techniques. The plant leaves were extracted with methanol and water at five various ratios (100, 75, 50, 25 and 0% v/v; water–methanol). Each extract was tested for -glucosidase inhibition, followed by analysis using liquid chromatography tandem to mass spectrometry. The data were further subjected to multivariate data analysis by means of an orthogonal partial least square in order to correlate the chemical profile and the bioactivity. The loading plots revealed that the m/z signals correspond to the activity of -glucosidase inhibitors, which led to the identification of three putative bioactive compounds, namely 5'-hydroxymethyl-1'-(1, 2, 3, 9-tetrahydro-pyrrolo (2, 1-b) quinazolin-1-yl)-heptan-1'-one (1), -terpinyl–glucoside (2), and machaeridiol-A (3). Molecular docking of the identified inhibitors was performed using Auto Dock Vina software against the crystal structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae isomaltase (Protein Data Bank code: 3A4A). Four hydrogen bonds were detected in the docked complex, involving several residues, namely ASP352, ARG213, ARG442, GLU277, GLN279, HIE280, and GLU411. Compound 1, 2, and 3 showed binding affinity values of -8.3, -7.6, and -10.0 kcal/mol, respectively, which indicate the good binding ability of the compounds towards the enzyme when compared to that of quercetin, a known -glucosidase inhibitor. The three identified compounds that showed potential binding affinity towards the enzymatic protein in molecular docking interactions could be the bioactive compounds associated with the traditional use of this plant.

In Vitro Antibacterial Activity of Manuka (Leptospermum scoparium J.R. et G. Forst) and winter Savory (Satureja montana L.) Essential Oils and Their Blends against Pathogenic E. coli Isolates from Pigs,"Neonatal diarrhoea (ND), post-weaning diarrhoea (PWD) and oedema disease (OD) are among the most important diseases affecting pig farming due to economic losses. Among the main aetiological agents, strains of Escherichia coli are identified as the major responsible pathogens involved. Several strategies have been put in place to prevent these infections and, today, research is increasingly studying alternative methods to antibiotics to reduce the antibiotic resistance phenomenon. Essential oils (EOs) are among the alternative tools that are being investigated. In this study, the in vitro effectiveness of winter savory and manuka essential oils and their mixtures in different proportions against strains of E. coli isolated from episodes of disease in pigs was evaluated. The EOs alone demonstrated slight antibacterial effectiveness, whereas the blends, by virtue of their synergistic action, showed remarkable activity, especially the 70%–30% winter savory–manuka blend, showing itself as a potential tool for prevention and therapy.

Chemoprevention of DMH-Induced Early Colon Carcinogenesis in Male BALB/c Mice by Administration of Lactobacillus Paracasei DTA81,"We evaluated the effects of the probiotic candidate Lactobacillus paracasei DTA81 (DTA81) on liver oxidative stress, colonic cytokine profile, and gut microbiota in mice with induced early colon carcinogenesis (CRC) by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH). Animals were divided into four different groups (n "
The Toxicity Exerted by the Antibiotic Sulfadiazine on the Growth of Soil Bacterial Communities May Increase over Time,"The toxicity exerted by the antibiotic sulfadiazine on the growth of soil bacterial communities was studied in two agricultural soils for a period of 100 days. In the short-term (2 days of incubation), the effect of sulfadiazine on bacterial growth was low (no inhibition or inhibition <32% for a dose of 2000 mgkg-1). However, sulfadiazine toxicity increased with time, achieving values of 40% inhibition, affecting bacterial growth in both soils after 100 days of incubation. These results, which were here observed for the first time for any antibiotic in soil samples, suggest that long-term experiments would be required for performing an adequate antibiotics risk assessment, as short-term experiments may underestimate toxicity effects.

Searching for New Tools to Counteract the Helicobacter pylori Resistance: The Positive Action of Resveratrol Derivatives,"The drug-resistance phenomenon in Helicobacter pylori underlines the need of novel strategies to improve the eradication rate including alternative treatments combining antibiotic and non-antibiotic compounds with synergistic action. In this study, the antibacterial (MIC/MBC) and anti-virulence effects (biofilm reduction and swarming motility inhibition) of resveratrol-RSV and new synthetized RSV-phenol derivatives, with a higher bioavailability, alone and combined with levofloxacin-LVX were evaluated against resistant H. pylori clinical strains. The experiments were confirmed in vivo using the Galleria mellonella model. Among the studied RSV derivatives, RSV-3 and RSV-4 possessed higher antibacterial activity with respect to RSV (MICs from 6.25 to 200 g/mL and from 3.12 to 200 g/mL, respectively). RSV, RSV-3, and RSV-4 were able to synergize with LVX restoring its effect in two out of seven clinical resistant strains tested for the study. RSV, RSV-3, and RSV-4, alone and with LVX at sub-MIC and sub-synergistic concentrations, significantly reduced the biofilm formation. Moreover, RSV-3 and RSV-4 reduced the H. pylori swarming motility on soft agar. RSV, RSV-3, and RSV-4 were non-toxic for G. mellonella larvae and displayed a protective effect against H. pylori infection. Overall, RSV–phenol derivatives should be considered interesting candidates for innovative therapeutic schemes to tackle the H. pylori antibiotic resistance. "
Identification of Cis-Regulatory Sequences Controlling Pollen-Specific Expression of Hydroxyproline-Rich Glycoprotein Genes in Arabidopsis thaliana,"Hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) are a superfamily of plant cell wall structural proteins that function in various aspects of plant growth and development, including pollen tube growth. We have previously characterized protein sequence signatures for three family members in the HRGP superfamily: the hyperglycosylated arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs), the moderately glycosylated extensins (EXTs), and the lightly glycosylated proline-rich proteins (PRPs). However, the mechanism of pollen-specific HRGP gene expression remains unexplored. To this end, we developed an integrative analysis pipeline combining RNA-seq gene expression and promoter sequences to identify cis-regulatory motifs responsible for pollen-specific expression of HRGP genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. Specifically, we mined the public RNA-seq datasets and identified 13 pollen-specific HRGP genes. Ensemble motif discovery identified 15 conserved promoter elements between A. thaliana and A. lyrata. Motif scanning revealed two pollen related transcription factors: GATA12 and brassinosteroid (BR) signaling pathway regulator BZR1. Finally, we performed a regression analysis and demonstrated that the 15 motifs provided a good model of HRGP gene expression in pollen (R "
A Bayesian Entropy Approach to Sectoral Systemic Risk Modeling,"We investigate the dynamics of systemic risk of European companies using an approach that merges paradigmatic risk measures such as Marginal Expected Shortfall, CoVaR, and Delta CoVaR, with a Bayesian entropy estimation method. Our purpose is to bring to light potential spillover effects of the entropy indicator for the systemic risk measures computed on the 24 sectors that compose the STOXX 600 index. Our results show that several sectors have a high proclivity for generating spillovers. In general, the largest influences are delivered by Capital Goods, Banks, Diversified Financials, Insurance, and Real Estate. We also bring detailed evidence on the sectors that are the most pregnable to spillovers and on those that represent the main contributors of spillovers. "
Identification of Seasonal Sub-Regions of the Drought in the North China Plain,"Regional climate variability assessment is of great significance in decision-making such as agriculture and water resources system management. The identification of sub-regions with similar drought variability can provide a basis for agricultural disaster reduction planning and water resource distribution. In this research, a modified daily Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) was used to monitor the spatial and temporal variation characteristics of agricultural drought in the North China Plain from 1960 to 2017, which was studied by using the rotated empirical orthogonal functions (REOF). Through the seasonal REOF process, 7–9 seasonal drought sub-regions are confirmed by applying time series and the correlation relationship of SPEI original data. The strong correlation of these sub-regions indicates that the climate and weather conditions causing the drought are consistent and the drought conditions are independent for the regions that show no correlation. In general, the results of the seasonal trend analysis show that there has been no significant trend value in most areas since 1960. However, it is worth noting that some regions have the positive and negative temporal trends in different seasons. These results illustrate the importance of seasonal analysis, particularly for agro-ecosystems that depend on timely rainfall during different growing seasons. If this trend continues, seasonal drought will become more complex, then a more elaborate water management strategy will be needed to reduce its impact. "

Monitoring Virgin Olive Oil Shelf-Life by Fluorescence Spectroscopy and Sensory Characteristics: A Multidimensional Study Carried Out under Simulated Market Conditions,"The control of virgin olive oil (VOO) freshness requires new tools that reflect the diverse chemical changes that take place during the market period. Fluorescence spectroscopy is one of the techniques that has been suggested for controlling virgin olive oil (VOO) freshness during its shelf-life. However, a complete interpretation of fluorescence spectra requires analyzing multiple parameters (chemical, physical–chemical, and sensory) to evaluate the pace of fluorescence spectral changes under moderate conditions with respect to other changes impacting on VOO quality. In this work, four VOOs were analyzed every month with excitation–emission fluorescence spectra. The same samples were characterized with the concentration of fluorophores (phenols, tocopherols, chlorophyll pigments), physical–chemical parameters (peroxide value, K232, K270, free acidity), and sensory attributes (medians of defects and of the fruity attribute). From the six components extracted with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), two components were assigned to chlorophyll pigments and those assigned to tocopherols, phenols, and oxidation products were selected for their ability to discriminate between fresh and aged oils. Thus, the component assigned to oxidation products correlated with K270 in the range 0.80–0.93, while the component assigned to tocopherols–phenols correlated with the fruity attribute in the range 0.52–0.90. The sensory analysis of the samples revealed that the changes of these PARAFAC components occurred at the same time as, or even before, the changes of the sensory characteristics. "
Droplet Reactors with Bioluminescent Enzymes for Real-Time Water Pollution Monitoring ,"Early detection of pollutants in wastewater, water coming out of treatment facilities, drinking water, and water for agricultural needs is a challenging problem. Effective water quality monitoring requires development of new methods for express detection of pollutants. Enzymes from bioluminescent bacteria can be used for the development of new express enzyme-based bioassay systems. This work demonstrates, for the first time, a microfluidic chip to generate emulsion droplets containing two enzymes of the bacterial bioluminescent system (luciferase and NAD(P)H:FMN-oxidoreductase) with reaction substrates. The developed chip generated ``water-in-oil'' emulsion droplets with a volume of 0.1 L and a frequency of up to 12 droplets per second. A portable photomultiplier tube (PMT) was used to measure the bioluminescent signal in each individual droplet; the signal-to-noise ratio was 3000/1. The intensity of luminescence in droplets depended on the concentration of copper ions. The limit of detection (LOD) for copper sulfate was 1 mg/L. We showed that bioluminescent enzymatic reactions can be carried out in droplet reactors that can be applied for online monitoring of water quality. Thus, the suggested method of biological measurements has a good perspective for biosensing in general. "

"The Amino Acid Changes T55A, A273P and R277C in the Beta-Lactamase CTX-M-14 Render E. coli Resistant to the Antibiotic Nitrofurantoin, a First-Line Treatment of Urinary Tract Infections","The antibiotic nitrofurantoin is a furan flanked by a nitro group and a hydantoin ring. It is used to treat lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) that have a lifetime incidence of 50-60% in adult women. UTIs are typically caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), which are increasingly expressing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), rendering them multi-drug resistant. Nitrofurantoin is a first-line treatment for gram-negative ESBL-positive UTI patients, given that resistance to it is still rare (0% to 4.4%). Multiplex PCR of -lactamase genes of the blaCTX-M groups 1, 2, 9 and 8/25 from ESBL-positive UTI patients treated at three referral hospitals in North Wales (UK) revealed the presence of a novel CTX-M-14-like gene harbouring the missense mutations T55A, A273P and R277C. While R277 is close to the active site, T55 and A273 are both located in external loops. Recombinant expression of CTX-M-14 and the mutated CTX-M-14 in the periplasm of E. coli revealed a significant increase in the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) for nitrofurantoin from 6 g/mL (CTX-M-14) to 512 g/mL (mutated CTX-M-14). Consistent with this finding, the mutated CTX-M protein hydrolysed nitrofurantoin in a cell-free assay. Detection of a novel nitrofurantoin resistance gene indicates an emerging clinical problem in the treatment of gram-negative ESBL-positive UTI patients. "
Relationship between Land Use/Land-Use Change and Human Health in Australia: A Scoping Study,"We undertook a scoping study to map the relevant evidence, summarise the findings, and to help identify gaps in the knowledge base on the relationship between land use/land-use change and human health in Australia. Our systematic search of the scientific literature for relevant articles up to August 2020 identified 37 articles. All 37 articles meeting our inclusion criteria were published after 2003. Zoonotic or vector-borne disease constituted the most common health outcome type studied. Agriculture/grazing was the land use/land-use change type most frequently represented in the literature, followed by coal seam gas extraction and open cut coal mining. The relationship between land use/land use change and human health in Australia, is not conclusive from the existing evidence. This is because of (1) a lack of comprehensive coverage of the topic, (2) a lack of coverage of the geography, (3) a lack of coverage of study types, and (4) conflicting results in the research already undertaken. If we are to protect human health and the ecosystems which support life, more high-quality, specific, end-user driven research is needed to support land management decisions in Australia. Until the health effects of further land use change are better known and understood, caution ought to be practiced in land management and land conversion. "
Doping Effect on Cu2Se Thermoelectric Performance: A Review,"Cu2Se, owing to its intrinsic excellent thermoelectric (TE) performance emerging from the peculiar nature of “liquid-like” Cu+ ions, has been regarded as one of the most promising thermoelectric materials recently. However, the commercial use is still something far from reach unless effective approaches can be applied to further increase the figure of merit (ZT) of Cu2Se, and doping has shown wide development prospect. Until now, the highest ZT value of 2.62 has been achieved in Al doped samples, which is twice as much as the original pure Cu2Se. Herein, various doping elements from all main groups and some transitional groups that have been used as dopants in enhancing the TE performance of Cu2Se are summarized, and the mechanisms of TE performance enhancement are analyzed. In addition, points of great concern for further enhancing the TE performance of doped Cu2Se are proposed. "
Assessment of Microvessel Permeability in Murine Atherosclerotic Vein Grafts Using Two-Photon Intravital Microscopy,"Plaque angiogenesis and plaque hemorrhage are major players in the destabilization and rupture of atherosclerotic lesions. As these are dynamic processes, imaging of plaque angiogenesis, especially the integrity or leakiness of angiogenic vessels, can be an extremely useful tool in the studies on atherosclerosis pathophysiology. Visualizing plaque microvessels in 3D would enable us to study the architecture and permeability of adventitial and intimal plaque microvessels in advanced atherosclerotic lesions. We hypothesized that a comparison of the vascular permeability between healthy continuous and fenestrated as well as diseased leaky microvessels, would allow us to evaluate plaque microvessel leakiness. We developed and validated a two photon intravital microscopy (2P-IVM) method to assess the leakiness of plaque microvessels in murine atherosclerosis-prone ApoE3*Leiden vein grafts based on the quantification of fluorescent-dextrans extravasation in real-time. We describe a novel 2P-IVM set up to study vessels in the neck region of living mice. We show that microvessels in vein graft lesions are in their pathological state more permeable in comparison with healthy continuous and fenestrated microvessels. This 2P-IVM method is a promising approach to assess plaque angiogenesis and leakiness. Moreover, this method is an important advancement to validate therapeutic angiogenic interventions in preclinical atherosclerosis models. "
"Impact of Employed Labor Force, Investment, and Remittances on Economic Growth in EU Countries","This paper analyzes the evolution and influence of gross domestic product per capita, labor force participation rate, gross fixed capital formation, and personal remittances on economic growth for European Union (EU) countries, using data from the World Bank (1996–2019) and from Eurostat (the first two quarters 2019–2020). The study has three components: statistical analysis, analysis of the evolution for each country and EU, and estimation of the impact on economic growth rate by using a linear multifactorial regression model for 1996–2019, 1996–2008, and 2009–2019. The model was validated by econometric techniques. The long-term causal relationship between exogenous and endogenous variables was validated by the Granger test. The results of the study show a differentiated evolution of the indicators, and that all indicators are severely affected by the 2008 financial crisis and the debut of the COVID-19 crisis in early 2020. The model used shows the significant positive influence of labor and investment, and the minor effect of remittances on economic growth. In the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, the results of the study could be arguments to be considered for the redesign of economic policies at European Union level. "
Membrane Protein Modified Electrodes in Bioelectrocatalysis,"Transmembrane proteins involved in metabolic redox reactions and photosynthesis catalyse a plethora of key energy-conversion processes and are thus of great interest for bioelectrocatalysis- based applications. The development of membrane protein modified electrodes has made it possible to efficiently exchange electrons between proteins and electrodes, allowing mechanistic studies and potentially applications in biofuels generation and energy conversion. Here, we summarise the most common electrode modification and their characterisation techniques for membrane proteins involved in biofuels conversion and semi-artificial photosynthesis. We discuss the challenges of applications of membrane protein modified electrodes for bioelectrocatalysis and comment on emerging methods and future directions, including recent advances in membrane protein reconstitution strategies and the development of microbial electrosynthesis and whole-cell semi-artificial photosynthesis.

The Impact of Graphene and Diatomite Admixtures on the Performance and Properties of High-Performance Magnesium Oxychloride Cement Composites,"A high-performance magnesium oxychloride cement (MOC) composite composed of silica sand, diatomite powder, and doped with graphene nanoplatelets was prepared and characterized. Diatomite was used as a 10 vol.% replacement for silica sand. The dosage of graphene was 0.5 wt.% of the sum of the MgO and MgCl26H2O masses. The broad product characterization included high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy analyses. The macrostructural parameters, pore size distribution, mechanical resistance, stiffness, hygric and thermal parameters of the composites matured for 28-days were also the subject of investigation. The combination of diatomite and graphene nanoplatelets greatly reduced the porosity and average pore size in comparison with the reference material composed of MOC and silica sand. In the developed composites, well stable and mechanically resistant phase 5 was the only precipitated compound. Therefore, the developed composite shows high compactness, strength, and low water imbibition which ensure high application potential of this novel type of material in the construction industry. "

An Improved HMM-Based Approach for Planning Individual Routes Using Crowd Sourcing Spatiotemporal Data,"With the rapid development of LBSs (location-based services) in recent years, researchers have increasingly taken an interest in trying to make travel routes more practicable and individualized. Despite the fact that many studies have been conducted on routes using LBS data, the specific routes are deficient in dynamic scalability and the correlations between environmental constraints and personal choices have not been investigated. This paper proposes an improved HMM-based (hidden Markov model) method for planning personalized routes with crowd sourcing spatiotemporal data. It tries to integrate the dynamic public preferences, the individual interests and the physical road network space in the same spatiotemporal framework, ensuring that reasonable routes will be generated. A novel dual-layer mapping structure has been proposed to bridge the gap from brief individual preferences to specific entries of POIs (points-of-interest) inside realistic road networks. A case study on Changsha city has proven that the proposed method can not only flexibly plan people's travel routes under different spatiotemporal backgrounds but also is close to people's natural selection by the perception of the group.

Labeled vs. Label-Free Raman Imaging of Lipids in Endothelial Cells of Various Origins,"Endothelial cells (EC) constitute a single layer of the lining of blood vessels and play an important role in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis. Endothelial dysfunction has been recognized as a primary or secondary cause of many diseases and it manifests itself, among others, by increased lipid content or a change in the lipid composition in the EC. Therefore, the analysis of cellular lipids is crucial to understand the mechanisms of disease development. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-)-induced inflammation of EC alters the lipid content of cells, which can be detected by Raman spectroscopy. By default, lipid detection is carried out in a label-free manner, and these compounds are recognized based on their spectral profile characteristics. We consider (3S,3'S)-astaxanthin (AXT), a natural dye with a characteristic resonance spectrum, as a new Raman probe for the detection of lipids in the EC of various vascular beds, i.e., the aorta, brain and heart. AXT colocalizes with lipids in cells, enabling imaging of lipid-rich cellular components in a time-dependent manner using laser power 10 times lower than that commonly used to measure biological samples. The results show that AXT can be used to study lipids distribution in EC at various locations, suggesting its use as a universal probe for studying cellular lipids using Raman spectroscopy. The use of labeled Raman imaging of lipids in the EC of various organs could contribute to their easier identification and to a better understanding of the development and progression of various vascular diseases, and it could also potentially improve their diagnosis and treatment.

Low-Temperature Synthesis of Monolithic Titanium Carbide/Carbon Composite Aerogel,"Resorcinol-formaldehyde/titanium dioxide composite (RF/TiO2) gel was prepared simultaneously by acid catalysis and then dried to aerogel with supercritical fluid CO2. The carbon/titanium dioxide aerogel was obtained by carbonization and then converted to nanoporous titanium carbide/carbon composite aerogel via 800 C magnesiothermic catalysis. Meanwhile, the evolution of the samples in different stages was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer, a scanning electron microscope (SEM), a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and specific surface area analysis (BET). The results showed that the final product was nanoporous TiC/C composite aerogel with a low apparent density of 339.5 mg/cm3 and a high specific surface area of 459.5 m2/g. Comparing to C aerogel, it could also be considered as one type of highly potential material with efficient photothermal conversion. The idea of converting oxide–carbon composite into titanium carbide via the confining template and low-temperature magnesiothermic catalysis may provide new sight to the synthesis of novel nanoscale carbide materials.

Identification of Metabolic Biomarkers in Relation to Methotrexate Response in Early Rheumatoid Arthritis,"This study aimed to identify baseline metabolic biomarkers for response to methotrexate (MTX) therapy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using an untargeted method. In total, 82 baseline plasma samples (41 insufficient responders and 41 sufficient responders to MTX) were selected from the Treatment in the Rotterdam Early Arthritis Cohort (tREACH, trial number: ISRCTN26791028) based on patients’ EULAR response at 3 months. Metabolites were assessed using high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry. Differences in metabolite concentrations between insufficient and sufficient responders were assessed using partial least square regression discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and Welch’s t-test. The predictive performance of the most significant findings was assessed in a receiver operating characteristic plot with area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity. Finally, overrepresentation analysis was performed to assess if the best discriminating metabolites were enriched in specific metabolic events. Baseline concentrations of homocystine, taurine, adenosine triphosphate, guanosine diphosphate and uric acid were significantly lower in plasma of insufficient responders versus sufficient responders, while glycolytic intermediates 1,3-/2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid, glycerol-3-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate were significantly higher in insufficient responders. Homocystine, glycerol-3-phosphate and 1,3-/2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid were independent predictors and together showed a high AUC of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.72–0.91) for the prediction of insufficient response, with corresponding sensitivity of 0.78 and specificity of 0.76. The Warburg effect, glycolysis and amino acid metabolism were identified as underlying metabolic events playing a role in clinical response to MTX in early RA. New metabolites and potential underlying metabolic events correlating with MTX response in early RA were identified, which warrant validation in external cohorts.20pt "
Influence of Parental Fatty Acid Desaturase 2 (fads2) Expression and Diet on Gilthead Seabream (Sparus aurata) Offspring fads2 Expression during Ontogenesis,"Previous studies have shown that it is possible to increase the ability of marine fish to produce long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid from their 18C precursors by nutritional programming or using broodstock with a higher fatty acyl desaturase 2 (fads2) expression. However, those studies failed to show the effect of these interventions on the expression of the fads2 gene in the developing egg. Moreover, there were no studies on the temporal expression of the fads2 during ontogeny in the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata). In order to determine the changes in expression of fads2 during ontogeny, gilthead sea bream broodstock with a high (HRO) or low (LRO) fads2 expression fed a diet previously used for nutritional programming, or a fish oil-based diet (LFO) were allowed to spawn. The samples were taken at the stages of spawning, morula, high blastula, gastrula, neurula, heart beating, hatch and 3 day-old first exogenous feeding larvae to determine fads2 expression throughout embryonic development. The results showed the presence of fads2 mRNA in the just spawned egg, denoting the maternal mRNA transfer to the developing oocyte. Later, fads2 expression increased after the neurula, from heart beating until 3-day-old larvae, denoting the transition from maternal to embryonic gene expression. In addition, the eggs obtained from broodstock with high fads2 expression showed a high docosahexaenoic acid content, which correlated with the downregulation of the fads2 expression found in the developing embryo and larvae. Finally, feeding with the nutritional programming diet with the partial replacement of fish oil by rapeseed oil did not affect the long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) contents nor fads2 expression in the gilthead sea bream developing eggs.

Strawberry Puree Functionalized with Natural Hydroxytyrosol: Effects on Vitamin C and Antioxidant Activity,"The natural antioxidant hydroxytyrosol (HT) was used to functionalize a strawberry puree. The effect of the antioxidant on the stability of the two bioactive forms of vitamin C (ascorbic acid-AA and dehydroascorbic acid-DHAA) in strawberry puree stored at 4 C, compared with the effect on a model system of AA in water, was investigated. In the absence of HT, the concentration of vitamin C in strawberry puree decreased but not in the model system. Low concentrations of HT in strawberry puree (0.05 and 0.1 mg HT/g puree) stabilized vitamin C and improved its antioxidant activity. However, at high concentrations of HT (from 0.5 mg HT/g puree), although the antioxidant activity improved, degradation of vitamin C occurred. Therefore, the concentration of HT used to obtain a functionalized strawberry puree it is very important. An adequate concentration increases the antioxidant activity and protects vitamin C from degradation, developing a functional food. However, an inadequate concentration of HT affects the vitamin C content, which is essential for the human diet because it cannot be biosynthetized by the organism. "
Finding the Dose for Ceftolozane-Tazobactam in Critically Ill Children with and without Acute Kidney Injury,"Background: Ceftolozane-tazobactam is a new antibiotic against multidrug-resistant pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosas. Ceftolozane-tazobactam dosage is still uncertain in children, especially in those with renal impairment or undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Methods: Evaluation of different ceftolozane-tazobactam dosing regimens in three critically ill children. Ceftolozane pharmacokinetics (PK) were characterized by obtaining the patient’s specific parameters by Bayesian estimation based on a population PK model. The clearance (CL) in patient C undergoing CRRT was estimated using the prefilter, postfilter, and ultrafiltrate concentrations simultaneously. Variables such as blood, dialysate, replacement, and ultrafiltrate flow rates, and hematocrit were integrated in the model. All PK analyses were performed using NONMEM v.7.4. Results: Patient A (8 months of age, 8.7 kg) with normal renal function received 40 mg/kg every 6 h: renal clearance (CLR) was 0.88 L/h; volume of distribution (Vd) Vd1 "
GWAS Based on RNA-Seq SNPs and High-Throughput Phenotyping Combined with Climatic Data Highlights the Reservoir of Valuable Genetic Diversity in Regional Tomato Landraces,"Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is a widely used model plant species for dissecting out the genomic bases of complex traits to thus provide an optimal platform for modern “-omics” studies and genome-guided breeding. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become a preferred approach for screening large diverse populations and many traits. Here, we present GWAS analysis of a collection of 115 landraces and 11 vintage and modern cultivars. A total of 26 conventional descriptors, 40 traits obtained by digital phenotyping, the fruit content of six carotenoids recorded at the early ripening (breaker) and red-ripe stages and 21 climate-related variables were analyzed in the context of genetic diversity monitored in the 126 accessions. The data obtained from thorough phenotyping and the SNP diversity revealed by sequencing of ripe fruit transcripts of 120 of the tomato accessions were jointly analyzed to determine which genomic regions are implicated in the expressed phenotypic variation. This study reveals that the use of fruit RNA-Seq SNP diversity is effective not only for identification of genomic regions that underlie variation in fruit traits, but also of variation related to additional plant traits and adaptive responses to climate variation. These results allowed validation of our approach because different marker-trait associations mapped on chromosomal regions where other candidate genes for the same traits were previously reported. In addition, previously uncharacterized chromosomal regions were targeted as potentially involved in the expression of variable phenotypes, thus demonstrating that our tomato collection is a precious reservoir of diversity and an excellent tool for gene discovery.

"HNC0014, a Multi-Targeted Small-Molecule, Inhibits Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma by Suppressing c-Met/STAT3/CD44/PD-L1 Oncoimmune Signature and Eliciting Antitumor Immune Responses","Despite advancements in diagnostic and standard treatment modalities, including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, overall survival rates of advanced-stage head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients have remained stagnant for over three decades. Failure of these treatment modalities, coupled with post-therapy complications, underscores the need for alternative interventions and an in-depth understanding of the complex signaling networks involved in developing treatment resistance. Using bioinformatics tools, we identified an increased expression of c-Met, STAT3, and CD44 corresponding to a poor prognosis and malignant phenotype of HNSCC. Subsequently, we showed that tumorsphere-derived exosomes promoted cisplatin (CDDP) resistance and colony and tumorsphere formation in parental HNSCC cells, accompanied by an increased level of oncogenic/immune evasive markers, namely, c-Met, STAT3, CD44, and PD-L1. We then evaluated the therapeutic potential of a new small molecule, HNC0014. The molecular docking analysis suggested strong interactions between HNC0014 and oncogenic molecules; c-Met, STAT3, CD44, and PD-L1. Subsequently, we demonstrated that HNC0014 treatment suppressed HNSCC tumorigenic and expression of stemness markers; HNC0014 also reduced cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) transformation by Exosp- and CAF-induced tumorigenic properties. HNC0014 treatment alone suppressed tumor growth in a cisplatin-resistant (SAS tumorspheres) mouse xenograft model and with higher inhibitory efficacy when combined with CDDP. More importantly, HNC0014 treatment significantly delayed tumor growth in a syngeneic mouse HNSCC model, elicited an antitumor immune profile, and reduced the total c-Met, STAT3, and their phosphorylated forms, PD-L1 and CD44, contents in serum exosomes. Collectively, our findings provide supports for HNC0014 as a multi-targeted immunotherapeutic lead compound for further development. "
Restraint Stress in Mice Alters Set of 25 miRNAs Which Regulate Stress- and Depression-Related mRNAs,"In the present study, we aim to identify the effect of restrain stress (RS) on the expression of miRNAs in mouse serum. We used three genotypes of animals (mice with knock-out of the gene-encoding norepinephrine transporter, NET-KO; C57BL/6J, and SWR/J) which had previously been shown to display different sensitivity to RS, and focused on miRNAs which were altered by RS in the serum of all three genotypes. An analysis of miRNAs expression allowed for the identification of a set of 25 differentially expressed miRNAs; 10 were down-regulated compared to an appropriate control group of animals, while 15 were up-regulated. The application of DIANA-miRPath v. 3.0 allowed for the identification of selected pathways (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) categories that were significantly controlled by these miRNAs, while miRWalk v. 3.0—the platform that used the machine learning based algorithm, TaRPmiR—was used to find their targets. The results indicate that 25 miRNAs, identified as altered upon RS in three genotypes of mice, are responsible for regulation of mRNA-encoding proteins that are key for the main hypotheses of depression; therefore, they may help to understand the link between stress and depression at the molecular level.

High Potency of Organic and Inorganic Nanoparticles to Treat Cystic Echinococcosis: An Evidence-Based Review,"Since there is no potential, effective vaccine available, treatment is the only controlling option against hydatid cyst or cystic echinococcosis (CE). This study was designed to systematically review the in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo effects of nanoparticles against hydatid cyst. The study was carried out based on the 06- PRISMA guideline and registered in the CAMARADES-NC3Rs Preclinical Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Facility (SyRF) database. The search was performed in five English databases, including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Google Scholar without time limitation for publications around the world about the protoscolicdal effects of all the organic and inorganic nanoparticles without date limitation in order to identify all the published articles (in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo). The searched words and terms were: “nanoparticles”, “hydatid cyst”, “protoscoleces”, “cystic echinococcosis”, “metal nanoparticles”, “organic nanoparticles”, “inorganic nanoparticles, “in vitro”, ex vivo”, “in vivo”. Out of 925 papers, 29 papers including 15 in vitro (51.7%), 6 in vivo (20.7%), ex vivo 2 (6.9%), and 6 in vitro/in vivo (20.7%) up to 2020 met the inclusion criteria for discussion in this systematic review. The results demonstrated the most widely used nanoparticles in the studies were metal nanoparticles such as selenium, silver, gold, zinc, copper, iron nanoparticles (n "

Environmental Sustainability of Digitalization in Manufacturing: A Review,"The rapid development and implementation of digitalization in manufacturing has enormous impact on the environment. It is still unclear whether digitalization has positive or negative environmental impact from applications in manufacturing. Therefore, this study aims to discuss the overall implications of digitalization on environmental sustainability through a literature study, within the scope of manufacturing (product design, production, transportation, and customer service). The analysis and categorization of selected articles resulted in two main findings: (1) Digitalization in manufacturing contributes positively to environmental sustainability by increasing resource and information efficiency as a result of applying Industry 4.0 technologies throughout the product lifecycle; (2) the negative environmental burden of digitalization is primarily due to increased resource and energy use, as well as waste and emissions from manufacturing, use, and disposal of the hardware (the technology lifecycle). Based on these findings, a lifecycle perspective is proposed, considering the environmental impacts from both the product and technology lifecycles. This study identified key implications of digitalization on environmental sustainability in manufacturing to increase awareness of both the positive and negative impacts of digitalization and thereby support decision making to invest in new digital technologies.

Performance Optimization and Characterization of Soda Residue-Fly Ash Geopolymer Paste for Goaf Backfill: Beta-Hemihydrate Gypsum Alternative to Sodium Silicate,"Solid waste soda residue (SR), as an industrial pollutant of water, air and soil environment, can be utilized to prepare the low-calcium fly ash (FFA)-based geopolymer paste activated by sodium silicate (NS) solution for goaf backfill. However, the high addition of NS produces the high cost and high strength of synthesized backfill material in the previous study. The objective of this research is to investigate the cost optimization method and performance evaluation of SR-FFA-based geopolymer backfill paste. The alkaline beta-hemihydrate gypsum (BHG) alternative to partial NS was proposed. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) as well as Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) tests were performed to clarify the role of BHG and evaluate the microstructures and products of backfill pastes. The results show that 10% BHG alternative ratios effectively improve fluidity, setting time and compressive strength to satisfy the performance requirement of goaf backfill material. The gel products in the optimal backfill paste C4 with 10% BHG alternative ratios are determined as the coexistence of C-S-H gel, (N,C)-A-S-H gel and CaSO42H2O at 28 d. The research results can make extensive utilization of SR and FFA in cemented paste backfill to synthesize cleaner material at a larger scale. "
Thioredoxin and Glutaredoxin Systems as Potential Targets for the Development of New Treatments in Friedreich’s Ataxia,"The thioredoxin family consists of a small group of redox proteins present in all organisms and composed of thioredoxins (TRXs), glutaredoxins (GLRXs) and peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) which are found in the extracellular fluid, the cytoplasm, the mitochondria and in the nucleus with functions that include antioxidation, signaling and transcriptional control, among others. The importance of thioredoxin family proteins in neurodegenerative diseases is gaining relevance because some of these proteins have demonstrated an important role in the central nervous system by mediating neuroprotection against oxidative stress, contributing to mitochondrial function and regulating gene expression. Specifically, in the context of Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA), thioredoxin family proteins may have a special role in the regulation of Nrf2 expression and function, in Fe-S cluster metabolism, controlling the expression of genes located at the iron-response element (IRE) and probably regulating ferroptosis. Therefore, comprehension of the mechanisms that closely link thioredoxin family proteins with cellular processes affected in FRDA will serve as a cornerstone to design improved therapeutic strategies.

An Extremum Principle for Smooth Problems,"We derive an extremum principle. It can be treated as an intermediate result between the celebrated smooth-convex extremum principle due to Ioffe and Tikhomirov and the Dubovitskii–Milyutin theorem. The proof of this principle is based on a simple generalization of the Fermat's theorem, the smooth-convex extremum principle and the local implicit function theorem. An integro-differential example illustrating the new principle is presented. "
The Inhibition of Prolyl Oligopeptidase as New Target to Counteract Chronic Venous Insufficiency: Findings in a Mouse Model,"(1) Background: Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a common disorder related to functional and morphological abnormalities of the venous system. Inflammatory processes and angiogenesis alterations greatly concur to the onset of varicose vein. KYP-2047 is a selective inhibitor of prolyl oligopeptidase (POP), a serine protease involved in the release of pro-angiogenic molecules. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the capacity of KYP-2047 to influence the angiogenic and inflammatory mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of CVI. (2) Methods: An in vivo model of CVI-induced by saphene vein ligation (SVL) and a tissue block culture study were performed. Mice were subjected to SVL followed by KYP-2047 treatment (intraperitoneal, 10 mg/kg) for 7 days. Histological analysis, Masson’s trichrome, Van Gieson staining, and mast cells evaluation were performed. Release of cytokines, nitric oxide synthase production, TGF-beta, VEGF, -smooth muscle actin, PREP, Endoglin, and IL-8 quantification were investigated. (3) Results: KYP-2047 treatment ameliorated the histological abnormalities of the venous wall, reduced the collagen increase and modulated elastin content, lowered cytokines levels and prevented mast degranulation. Moreover, a decreased expression of TGF-beta, eNOS, VEGF, -smooth muscle actin, IL-8, and PREP was observed in in vivo study; also a reduction in VEGF and Endoglin expression was confirmed in tissue block culture study. (4) Conclusions: For the first time, this research, highlighting the importance of POP as new target for vascular disorders, revealed the therapeutic potential of KYP-2047 as a helpful treatment for the management of CVI.

Disruption of Cell Adhesion and Cytoskeletal Networks by Thiol-Functionalized Silica-Coated Iron Oxide Nanoparticles,"One of the major obstacles that limits the use of magnetic nanoparticles in biomedical applications is their potential toxicity. In the present study, we evaluated the cytotoxic effects of thiol-functionalized silica-coated iron oxide (Fe3O4@SiO2-SH) nanoparticles using human lung epithelial cells A549. We investigated the effect of Fe3O4@SiO2-SH nanoparticles on the cell viability, proliferation, cell cycle distribution, adhesion, apoptosis, and the orientation of the cytoskeletal networks, as well as on expression of proteins involved in cell death, cell survival, and cell adhesion. We demonstrated that exposure of A549 cells to Fe3O4@SiO2-SH nanoparticles resulted in severe disruption of the actin microfilaments and microtubule cytoskeleton and reduced the size of focal adhesions. Furthermore, cell adhesion was significantly affected as well as the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and p38. Our findings highlight the need for in-depth cytotoxic evaluation of nanoparticles supporting their safer use, especially in biomedical applications. "
Comparison of Growth and Yield Characteristics of Mid-Season Hybrid Rice under Different Yield Levels,"Analysis of growth and yield characteristics of rice with different yield levels is very important for the breeding of high-yield rice cultivators. To investigate the yield components’ variation, morphological characteristics of the panicles, leaves, and stems of rice varieties under different yield levels, a two-year field experiment was conducted in Chongqing China. The 20 mid-season Indica hybrid rice varieties were classified into three groups based on yield, comprising high-yield group (HG), mid-yield group (MG), and low-yield group (LG). The main reason for the superior yield of HG is that the varieties of this group had a significantly higher number of effective panicles per unit area than the MG and LG. In plant type factors, the leaf type factors were the most important reason causing yield difference of HG, MG, and LG. The average leaf roll index, average leaf length to width ratio, average leaf base angle, average leaf droop angle, and average leaf pillow distance of the upper three leaves were significantly or significantly negatively correlated with the yield, while the average leaf width, average leaf area, and the average distance of leaf edge were significantly or significantly positively correlated with yield, and the leaf droop angle was the most important plant type factor affecting the yield. Based on these results, we further quantified the plant type factors of HG and constructed an ideal plant type model for high-yield hybrid mid-season rice. Theoretical and practical basis could be provided for breeding mid-season Indica hybrid rice with super-high yield in the future to ensure food security. "
"Alpha Ketoglutarate Exerts In Vitro Anti-Osteosarcoma Effects through Inhibition of Cell Proliferation, Induction of Apoptosis via the JNK and Caspase 9-Dependent Mechanism, and Suppression of TGF- and VEGF Production and Metastatic Potential of Cells","Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common type of primary bone tumor. Currently, there are limited treatment options for metastatic OS. Alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG), i.e., a multifunctional intermediate of the Krebs cycle, is one of the central metabolic regulators of tumor fate and plays an important role in cancerogenesis and tumor progression. There is growing evidence suggesting that AKG may represent a novel adjuvant therapeutic opportunity in anti-cancer therapy. The present study was intended to check whether supplementation of Saos-2 and HOS osteosarcoma cell lines (harboring a TP53 mutation) with exogenous AKG exerted an anti-cancer effect. The results revealed that AKG inhibited the proliferation of both OS cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner. As evidenced by flow cytometry, AKG blocked cell cycle progression at the G1 stage in both cell lines, which was accompanied by a decreased level of cyclin D1 in HOS and increased expression of p21Waf1/Cip1 protein in Saos-2 cells (evaluated with the ELISA method). Moreover, AKG induced apoptotic cell death and caspase-3 activation in both OS cell lines (determined by cytometric analysis). Both the immunoblotting and cytometric analysis revealed that the AKG-induced apoptosis proceeded predominantly through activation of an intrinsic caspase 9-dependent apoptotic pathway and an increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. The apoptotic process in the AKG-treated cells was mediated via c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) activation, as the specific inhibitor of this kinase partially rescued the cells from apoptotic death. In addition, the AKG treatment led to reduced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and significant inhibition of cell migration and invasion in vitro concomitantly with decreased production of pro-metastatic transforming growth factor  (TGF-) and pro-angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in both OS cell lines suggesting the anti-metastatic potential of this compound. In conclusion, we showed the anti-osteosarcoma potential of AKG and provided a rationale for a further study of the possible application of AKG in OS therapy. "
Exploring Herbal Medicine Use during Palliative Cancer Care: The Integrative Physician as a Facilitator of Pharmacist–Patient–Oncologist Communication,"Oncology patients frequently use herbal and other forms of complementary medicine, often without the knowledge of oncologists, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals responsible for their care. Oncology healthcare professionals may lack the knowledge needed to guide their patients on the safe and effective use of herbal medicinal products, a number of which have potentially harmful effects, which include direct toxicity and negative herb–drug interactions. The current review addresses the prevalence and expectations of oncology patients from herbal medicine, as well as evidence for the beneficial or harmful effects of this practice (potential and actual), especially when the herbal products are used in conjunction with anticancer agents. Models of integrative oncology care are described, in which open and effective communication among oncologists, pharmacists, and integrative physicians on the use of herbal medicine by their patients occurs. This collaboration provides patients with a nonjudgmental and multidisciplinary approach to integrative medicine, echoing their own health-belief models of care during conventional cancer treatments. The role of the integrative physician is to facilitate this process, working with oncologists and pharmacists in the fostering of patient-centered palliative care, while ensuring a safe and effective treatment environment. Case scenario: W. is a 56 year old female artist who was recently diagnosed with localized hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Following lumpectomy and sentinel node dissection, she is scheduled to begin adjuvant chemotherapy with a regimen which will include adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel (AC-T protocol). She is worried about developing peripheral neuropathy and its impact on her ability to paint, and she asks about a number of dietary supplements which she heard could prevent this from happening: omega-3, vitamin E, alpha-lipoic acid, and acetyl-l-carnithine. She is concerned, however, that the supplements may negatively interact with her chemotherapy regimen. "
Application of Geostatistical Analysis and Random Forest for Source Analysis and Human Health Risk Assessment of Potentially Toxic Elements (PTEs) in Arable Land Soil,"Arable land soil is one of the most precious natural resources of Earth, it provides the fundamental material and numerous resources essential for the development of human society. To determine the pollution of potential toxic factors in the surface soil of cultivated land and its risks to human health, concentrations of five different potentially toxic elements (PTEs) were detected in 1109 soil samples collected in Xiangzhou, China, in 2019. In this study, health risk assessment was used to judge the degree of pollution in the study area, the result of Geographic Information System (GIS) was as used to research the spatial distribution characteristics of PTEs, and random forest (RF) was used to assess the natural and man-made influencing factors. We investigated the sources of PTEs through quantifying the indicators, which gave further insights. The main results are: (1) In arable land soil, the average content of PTEs is 0.14 mg/kg cadmium (Cd), 0.05 mg/kg mercury (Hg), 12.89 mg/kg arsenic (As), 29.23 mg/kg lead (Pb), and 78.58 mg/kg chromium (Cr), respectively. The content of As and Pb outpaced the background value of Hubei soil. (2) The human health risk assessment in Xiangzhou indicates that the most important exposure pathway is soil ingestion, occupied about 99% to health risks of PTEs; non-carcinogenic risk from exposure to As, Pb and Cr in soil was higher than the limit (overall potential risk index, HI > 1) for both children and adults. Moreover, carcinogenic risk postured by Cd, Cr, and As was higher than the limit (10-4) through soil exposure for both children and adults, indicating that Cd, As, Pb and Cr in soil have significant effect on people’s health through exposure. (3) We found that the increased PTEs in the arable land soil mainly originated from potential water sources, air and soil pollution sources, breeding farms, and mining areas. "
Albanol B from Mulberries Exerts Anti-Cancer Effect through Mitochondria ROS Production in Lung Cancer Cells and Suppresses In Vivo Tumor Growth,"Albanol B (ABN-B), an arylbenzofuran derivative isolated from mulberries, has been shown to have anti-Alzheimer’s disease, anti-bacterial and antioxidant activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-cancer effect of this compound against lung cancer cells. The results show that ABN-B inhibited the proliferation of four human lung cancer cell lines (A549, BZR, H1975, and H226) and induced apoptosis, based on the cleavage of caspase-7 and PARP (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase), as well as the downregulation of Bcl-2. ABN-B also induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M by down-regulating the expression of CKD1 (cyclin-dependent kinase 1) and cyclin B1, but up-regulating p21 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1) expression. Notably, ABN-B increased the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS); however, treatment with mito-TEMPO (a specific mitochondrial antioxidant) blocked ABN-B-induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M and apoptosis, as well as the up-regulation of p21 and down-regulation of CDK1 and cyclin B1 induced by ABN-B. At the molecular level, ABN-B-induced mitochondrial ROS production increased the phosphorylation levels of AKT (protein kinase B) and ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2), while the inhibition of these kinases blocked the ABN-B-induced up-regulation of p21 and down-regulation of CDK1 and cyclin B1. Moreover, ABN-B significantly suppressed tumor growth in Ex-3LL (Lewis lung carcinoma) tumor-bearing mice. Taken together, these results suggest that ABN-B can exert an anti-cancer effect by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G2/M through mitochondrial ROS production in lung cancer cells. "
Fighting Iron-Deficiency Anemia: Innovations in Food Fortificants and Biofortification Strategies,"Iron deficiency remains one of the main nutritional disorders worldwide and low iron intake and/or bioavailability are currently the major causes of anemia. To fight this public health problem, the scientific challenge is to find an iron form with sufficient bioavailability to increase its levels in humans through food fortification. In turn, biofortification appears as a comparatively advantageous and bearable strategy for the delivery of vitamins and other micronutrients for people without access to a healthy and diverse diet. This approach relies on plant breeding, transgenic techniques, or agronomic practices to obtain a final food product with a higher iron content. It is also known that certain food constituents are able to favor or inhibit iron absorption. The management of these compounds can thus successfully improve the absorption of dietary iron and, ultimately, contribute to fight this disorder present all over the world. This review describes the main causes/manifestations of iron-deficiency anemia, forms of disease prevention and treatment, and the importance of a balanced and preventive diet. A special focus was given to innovative food fortification and biofortification procedures used to improve the iron content in staple food crops. "
Potential of FTIR-Spectroscopy for Drugs Screening against Helicobacter pylori,"Helicobacter pylori colonizes the human stomach of half of the world’s population. The infection if not treated, persists through life, leading to chronic gastric inflammation, that may progress to severe diseases as peptic ulcer, gastric adenocarcinoma, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. The first line of treatment, based on 7 to 21 days of two antibiotics associated with a proton pump inhibitor, is, however, already failing most due to patient non-compliance that leads to antibiotic resistance. It is, therefore, urgent to screen for new and more efficient antimicrobials against this bacterium. In this work, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was evaluated to screen new drugs against H. pylori, in rapid (between 1 to 6 h), and high-throughput mode and based on a microliter volume processes in relation to the agar dilution method. The reference H. pylori strains 26,695 and J99, were evaluated against a peptide-based antimicrobial and the clinical antibiotic clarithromycin, respectively. After optimization of the assay conditions, as the composition of the incubation mixture, the time of incubation, and spectral pre-processing, it was possible to reproducibly observe the effect of the drug on the bacterial molecular fingerprint as pointed by the spectra principal component analysis. The spectra, obtained from both reference strains, after its incubation with drugs concentrations lower than the MIC, presented peak ratios statistically different (p < 0.05) in relation to the bacteria incubated with drugs concentrations equal or higher to the MIC. It was possible to develop a partial least square regression model, enabling to predict from spectra of both bacteria strains, the drug concentration on the assay, with a high correlation coefficient between predicted and experimental data (0.91) and root square error of 40% of the minimum inhibitory concentration. All this points to the high potential of the technique for drug screening against this fastidious growth bacterium. "
"Characterization and Analysis of Okoume and Aiele Essential Oils from Gabon by GC-MS, Electronic Nose, and Their Antibacterial Activity Assessment","Essential oil resins of Aucoumea klaineana (Okoume) and Canarium schweinfurthii (Aiele) species, of the Burseraceae family, were studied to investigate their bioactive constituents and their antibacterial activities. Aiele resin had a higher yield (6.86%) of essential oil than Okoume (3.62%). Twenty-one compounds for Okoume and eighteen for Aiele essential oil were identified using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Gp-C-MS) technique. The main compounds identified in Okoume essential oil were benzenemethanol, , ,4-trimethyl (28.85%), (+)-3-carene (3,7,7-trimethyl bicyclo[4.1.0]hept-3-ene) (17.93%), D-Limonene ((4R)-1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene) (19.36%). With regard to the Aiele essential oil, we identified (1R,4S)-1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol (26.64%), and 1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol (26.83%). Two strains of bacteria, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, were used in antibacterial tests. S. aureus was found to be more sensitive to Okoume and Aiele essential oils, with a high inhibition zone ranging from 20 to 16 mm. In comparison, the inhibition zone ranged from 6 to 12 mm for E. coli. An electronic nose (e-nose) combined with pattern analysis methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), discriminant function analysis (DFA), and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were used to discriminate the essential oil samples. In summary, the e-nose and GC-MS allowed the identification of bioactive compounds in the essential oil samples, which have a strong antimicrobial activity, with satisfactory results. "
Rheological and Drug Delivery Characteristics of Poloxamer-Based Diclofenac Sodium Formulations for Chronic Wound Site Analgesia,"Chronic wounds are a significant and growing health problem, and clinical treatment is often a painful experience. A topical dosage form would be optimal to treat this pain. Poloxamer 407, a thermosensitive polymer that is a liquid at low temperatures but gels at higher temperatures, is well suited to administer topical analgesics to chronic wound sites. The goal of this study was to evaluate the gelation and drug delivery properties of poloxamer 407 gels containing diclofenac sodium for potential use in chronic wound analgesic delivery. The gelation properties of poloxamer formulations were evaluated rheologically. Drug delivery properties of poloxamers loaded with diclofenac sodium were evaluated using snakeskin dialysis membranes, intact porcine ear skin, and porcine ear skin impaired via tape stripping. A commercial gel product and a solution of diclofenac sodium in water were used as control formulations. Poloxamer concentration and gelation temperature varied inversely, and the addition of higher concentrations of diclofenac sodium correlated to significant increases in poloxamer gelation temperature. Poloxamer solutions were effective in limiting the permeation of diclofenac sodium through membranes with impaired barrier properties, and delivery of diclofenac sodium from poloxamer 407 did not vary significantly from delivery observed from the commercial gel product. The amount of drug delivered in 24 h did not change significantly with changes in poloxamer 407 concentration. The results of this study indicate that poloxamer 407 may be a useful formulation component for administration of an analgesic product to a chronic wound site. "

The Epidemiology of Plant Virus Disease: Towards a New Synthesis,"Epidemiology is the science of how disease develops in populations, with applications in human, animal and plant diseases. For plant diseases, epidemiology has developed as a quantitative science with the aims of describing, understanding and predicting epidemics, and intervening to mitigate their consequences in plant populations. Although the central focus of epidemiology is at the population level, it is often necessary to recognise the system hierarchies present by scaling down to the individual plant/cellular level and scaling up to the community/landscape level. This is particularly important for diseases caused by plant viruses, which in most cases are transmitted by arthropod vectors. This leads to range of virus-plant, virus-vector and vector-plant interactions giving a distinctive character to plant virus epidemiology (whilst recognising that some fungal, oomycete and bacterial pathogens are also vector-borne). These interactions have epidemiological, ecological and evolutionary consequences with implications for agronomic practices, pest and disease management, host resistance deployment, and the health of wild plant communities. Over the last two decades, there have been attempts to bring together these differing standpoints into a new synthesis, although this is more apparent for evolutionary and ecological approaches, perhaps reflecting the greater emphasis on shorter often annual time scales in epidemiological studies. It is argued here that incorporating an epidemiological perspective, specifically quantitative, into this developing synthesis will lead to new directions in plant virus research and disease management. This synthesis can serve to further consolidate and transform epidemiology as a key element in plant virus research. "
Designing Mechanical Properties of 3D Printed Cookies through Computer Aided Engineering,"Additive manufacturing or 3D printing can be applied in the food sector to create food products with personalized properties such as shape, texture, and composition. In this article, we introduce a computer aided engineering (CAE) methodology to design 3D printed food products with tunable mechanical properties. The focus was on the Young modulus as a proxy of texture. Finite element modelling was used to establish the relationship between the Young modulus of 3D printed cookies with a honeycomb structure and their structure parameters. Wall thickness, cell size, and overall porosity were found to influence the Young modulus of the cookies and were, therefore, identified as tunable design parameters. Next, in experimental tests, it was observed that geometry deformations arose during and after 3D printing, affecting cookie structure and texture. The 3D printed cookie porosity was found to be lower than the designed one, strongly influencing the Young modulus. After identifying the changes in porosity through X-ray micro-computed tomography, a good match was observed between computational and experimental Young’s modulus values. These results showed that changes in the geometry have to be quantified and considered to obtain a reliable prediction of the Young modulus of the 3D printed cookies. "
"Tick Fauna and Associated Rickettsia, Theileria, and Babesia spp. in Domestic Animals in Sudan (North Kordofan and Kassala States)","Ticks and tick-borne diseases (TBDs) have a major economic impact on animal production worldwide. In the present study, 2410 ticks were collected from January to August 2017 from livestock and other domestic animals in North Kordofan and Kassala, Sudan, for species identification and investigation of Rickettsia spp. and piroplasms, either individually or as pools containing up to 10 ticks by molecular methods. In total, 13 tick species were identified by morphology and 16S rDNA sequencing. The most frequent tick species were Hyalomma impeltatum (24.90%), Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi (18.84%), Amblyomma lepidum (16.06%), and Rhipicephalus camicasi (12.49%). A pan-Rickettsia real-time PCR revealed an overall minimum infection rate (MIR) with Rickettsia spp. of 5.64% (136 positive tick pools/2410 total ticks). Rickettsia africae and Rickettsia aeschlimannii were the most frequently identified species by sequencing. Furthermore, the following highly pathogenic livestock parasites were detected: Theileria annulata, Theileria lestoquardi, Theileria equi, and Babesia caballi. The present study documented Rhipicephalus afranicus as well as Rickettsia conorii israelensis, Rickettsia massiliae, and Babesia pecorum for the first time in Sudan. These findings are significant for the animal production sector as well as in terms of One Health, as the detected Rickettsia spp. can cause serious illness in humans. "

Regio- and Stereoselective Reaction of Sodium Selenide with 3-Trimethylsilyl-2-propynamides","The efficient regio- and stereoselective synthesis of (Z,Z)-3,3'-selanediylbis(2-propenamides) in 76–93% yields was developed based on the reaction of sodium selenide with 3-trimethylsilyl-2- propynamides. (Z,Z)-3,3'-Selanediylbis(2-propenamides) are a novel class of organoselenium compounds. To date, not a single representative of 3,3'-selanediylbis(2-propenamides) has been described in the literature. Studying glutathione peroxidase-like properties by a model reaction showed that the activity of the obtained products significantly varies depending on the organic moieties in the amide group. Divinyl selenide, which contains two lipophilic cyclohexyl substituents in the amide group, exhibits very high glutathione peroxidase-like activity and this compound is considerably superior to other products in this respect.

"Pharmacists’ Knowledge, Attitude and Practice Regarding the Dispensing of Antibiotics without Prescription in Tanzania: An Explorative Cross-Sectional Study","Inappropriate use of antibiotics has been reported to contribute to the emergence and increase of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the world. The pharmacist has the responsibility to supervise the dispensing of antibiotics with prescriptions to ensure rational use. An online semi-structured questionnaire was shared with approximately 1100 licensed pharmacists in Tanzania. Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools before use for analysis. Of the 226 (20.5%) received responses, 197 had given consent and provided complete surveys. Notably, 153 (77.7%) of the 197 pharmacists had excellent knowledge about the legal requirements for dispensing antibiotics and the AMR challenge. Of the 197 surveyed pharmacists, 143 (72.6%) admitted to dispensing antibiotics without a prescription in their daily practice. Notably, 84.1% (37/44) of pharmacists with masters or PhD education were more likely to dispense without a prescription compared to 69.3% (106/153) among bachelor holders (p-value "
Changes in the Compound Drought and Extreme Heat Occurrence in the 1961–2018 Period at the European Scale,"Compound extreme weather events can cause large economic damage and endanger human lives. Therefore, identification of changes in such compound event frequency and magnitude is important information that could be useful for decision makers and practitioners in water management and agriculture sector. This is especially the case for dry hazards that can be significantly influenced by the increasing air temperature and can have significant impact on water availability and consumption as well as on agricultural production. This study investigated changes in the compound occurrence of drought and extreme heat at the European scale using Uncertainties in Ensembles of Regional Reanalyses (UERRA) regional reanalysis data for the 1961–2018 period. The effective drought index (EDI) and the air temperature percentile threshold were used for the identification of the compound events at the catchment scale where entire Europe was divided into more than 4000 catchments. The results revealed multiple hotspots of compound drought and extreme heat events such as parts of Western Europe, Italy, Balkan Peninsula and Northern and Eastern Europe. At the continental scale, no uniform trend pattern could be detected. However, multiple areas with either positive or negative changes were identified. A positive change was characteristic for parts of Western Europe, Italy, Balkan Peninsula, etc. In these cases, the trend was mostly driven by the decreasing total precipitation trend and was not directly affected by the increasing air temperature trend. Areas with negative changes include parts of Northern and Eastern Europe and British Isles. In these cases, the detected trend was mostly driven by an increasing total precipitation trend. However, local drivers could be different. "
"Green Composites Based on Unsaturated Polyester Resin from Recycled Poly(Ethylene Terephthalate) with Wood Flour as Filler—Synthesis, Characterization and Aging Effect","The paper investigates the synthesis of green composites and their properties before and after the laboratory accelerated aging tests. Materials were made of unsaturated polyester resins (UPRs) based on recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and wood flour (WF). The effect of dibenzylideneacetone (dba) addition on mechanical and thermomechanical properties was also determined. Green composites were obtained using environment friendly polymeric cobalt as an accelerator. Before and after exposition to the xenon lamp radiation, the UPRs physically modified by WF were characterized only by a greater flexural modulus compared with the analogous composites based on the pure resin. Addition of dba caused the increase of flexural modulus, flexural strength, strain at break and mechanical loss factor compared to the non-modified material. After aging only the last mentioned parameter took on lower values compared to the pure resin analogues. "
Development and Characterization of “Green Open-Cell Polyurethane Foams” with Reduced Flammability,"This work presents the cell structure and selected properties of polyurethane (PUR) foams, based on two types of hydroxylated used cooking oil and additionally modified with three different flame retardants. Bio-polyols from municipal waste oil with different chemical structures were obtained by transesterification with triethanolamine (UCO_TEA) and diethylene glycol (UCO_DEG). Next, these bio-polyols were used to prepare open-cell polyurethane foams of very low apparent densities for thermal insulation applications. In order to obtain foams with reduced flammability, the PUR systems were modified with different amounts (10–30 parts per hundred polyol by weight—php) of flame retardants: TCPP (tris(1-chloro-2-propyl)phosphate), TEP (triethyl phosphate), and DMPP (dimethyl propylphosphonate). The flame retardants caused a decrease of the PUR formulations reactivity. The apparent densities of all the foams were comparable in the range 12–15 kg/m3. The lowest coefficients of thermal conductivity were measured for the open-cell PUR foams modified with DMPP. The lowest values of heat release rate were found for the foams based on the UCO_TEA and UCO_DEG bio-polyols that were modified with 30 php of DMPP. "
Tissue Acidosis Associated with Ischemic Stroke to Guide Neuroprotective Drug Delivery,"Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Yet, the effective therapy of focal cerebral ischemia has been an unresolved challenge. We propose here that ischemic tissue acidosis, a sensitive metabolic indicator of injury progression in cerebral ischemia, can be harnessed for the targeted delivery of neuroprotective agents. Ischemic tissue acidosis, which represents the accumulation of lactic acid in malperfused brain tissue is significantly exacerbated by the recurrence of spreading depolarizations. Deepening acidosis itself activates specific ion channels to cause neurotoxic cellular Ca2+ accumulation and cytotoxic edema. These processes are thought to contribute to the loss of the ischemic penumbra. The unique metabolic status of the ischemic penumbra has been exploited to identify the penumbra zone with imaging tools. Importantly, acidosis in the ischemic penumbra may also be used to guide therapeutic intervention. Agents with neuroprotective promise are suggested here to be delivered selectively to the ischemic penumbra with pH-responsive smart nanosystems. The administered nanoparticels release their cargo in acidic tissue environment, which reliably delineates sites at risk of injury. Therefore, tissue pH-targeted drug delivery is expected to enrich sites of ongoing injury with the therapeutical agent, without the risk of unfavorable off-target effects. "
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms: One Step Closer to a Standardized Method,"The ability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to form biofilm during a long-term infection makes it difficult to treat patients correctly. The current clinical antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods are based on the study of planktonic strains. A standardized protocol to analyze the antimicrobial susceptibility in biofilms is necessary for routine laboratories. The aims of this study were to develop a simple biofilm model and to study the antimicrobial susceptibility of P. aeruginosa strains in biofilm growth. Different artificial sputum media, and aerobiosis and microaerobiosis conditions were analyzed using a microtiter plate method and P. aeruginosa PAO1 as reference strain. Planktonic and biofilm antimicrobial susceptibility to cefepime, imipenem, azithromycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, and ciprofloxacin were determined in clinical and non-clinical P. aeruginosa strains. The Synthetic Cystic Fibrosis Medium was proposed as a good medium. The biofilm greatly increased the resistance to tested antimicrobials, except for azithromycin. Cefepime and imipenem showed poor anti-biofilm effect while tobramycin, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin showed good activity in some strains. Azithromycin showed a better activity in biofilm than in planktonic state when aerobic conditions were used. This study establishes useful information to test antimicrobial susceptibility in P. aeruginosa biofilms, and includes possible antimicrobial options to treat long-term infected patients. "

Deep Learning-Based Cell-Level and Beam-Level Mobility Management System ,"The deployment with beamforming-capable base stations in 5G New Radio (NR) requires an efficient mobility management system to reliably operate with minimum effort and interruption. In this work, we propose two artificial neural network models to optimize the cell-level and beam-level mobility management. Both models consist of convolutional, as well as dense, layer blocks. Based on current and past received power measurements, as well as positioning information, they choose the optimum serving cell and serving beam, respectively. The obtained results show that the proposed cell-level mobility model is able to sustain a strong serving cell and reduce the number of handovers by up to 94.4% compared to the benchmark solution when the uncertainty (representing shadowing, interference, etc.) is introduced to the received signal strength measurements. The proposed beam-level mobility management model is able to proactively choose and sustain the strongest serving beam, even when high uncertainty is introduced to the measurements. "
Bevacizumab Augments the Antitumor Efficacy of Infigratinib in Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling cascade is one of the key signaling pathways in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). FGF has been shown to augment vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated HCC development and angiogenesis, as well as to potentially lead to resistance to VEGF/VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-targeted agents. Thus, novel agents targeting FGF/FGF receptor (FGFR) signaling may enhance and/or overcome de novo or acquired resistance to VEGF-targeted agents in HCC. Mice bearing high- and low-FGFR tumors were treated with Infigratinib (i.e., a pan-FGFR kinase inhibitor) and/or Bevacizumab (i.e., an angiogenesis inhibitor). The antitumor activity of both agents was assessed individually or in combination. Tumor vasculature, intratumoral hypoxia, and downstream targets of FGFR signaling pathways were also investigated. Infigratinib, when combined with Bevacizumab, exerted a synergistic inhibitory effect on tumor growth, invasion, and lung metastasis, and it significantly improved the overall survival of mice bearing FGFR-dependent HCC. Infigratinib/Bevacizumab promoted apoptosis, inhibited cell proliferation concomitant with upregulation of p27, and reduction in the expression of FGFR2-4, p-FRS-2, p-ERK1/2, p-p70S6K/4EBP1, Cdc25C, survivin, p-Cdc2, and p-Rb. Combining Infigratinib/Bevacizumab may provide therapeutic benefits for a subpopulation of HCC patients with FGFR-dependent tumors. A high level of FGFR-2/3 may serve as a potential biomarker for patient selection to Infigratinib/Bevacizumab. "
"Traditional Usage of Wild Fauna among the Local Inhabitants of Ladakh, Trans-Himalayan Region","Zootherapy is accepted all around the globe not only in ancient cultures but different animal derived medicines are also part of the practice in the modern health care systems. The present study assessed the traditional ethnozoological usage of wild animals by local inhabitants in Ladakh region, India, and the reference data for scientific approaches for protection of faunal diversity in trans-Himalayas. The ethnozoological documentation of the animals in Ladakh was carried out through semistructured and close-ended questionnaire surveys and interviews. Multivariate ecological community analysis was used to elucidate the relationship between ethnozoological usage and animal species. Our results showed three animal usage clusters with 32% similarity. Moreover, the similarity in animal usage between digging tools, trophy, handle of tools, decoration, and matting, showed less than 32% of similarity. The highest priority of local people was for food followed by decoration and medicinal usage. The most frequently used animal parts were meat followed by fur and horn. Medicinal uses of 48% of the reported species, i.e., Alectoris chukar (chukar), Cuon alpinus (Asiatic wild dog), Lepus oiostolus (hares), Marmota himalayana (marmots), Ovis aries vignei (Ladakh urial), Pantholops hodgsonii (Tibetan antelope), Procapra picticaudata (Tibetan gazelle), Pseudois nayaur (blue sheep), Tetraogallus himalayensis (Himalayan snow), Tetraogallus tibetanus (Tibetan snow cock), and Lutra lutra (common otter) were reported for the first time from this region. Our study provides innovative information regarding the ethnozoological knowledge in the Ladakh region and reference data for policymakers, researchers, land managers, common public, and the other stakeholders to develop logical and scientific approaches for sustainable use of faunal diversity in hotspot regions like trans-Himalayas and other similar biodiversity-rich sites.

ROS and Ions in Cell Signaling during Sexual Plant Reproduction,"Pollen grain is a unique haploid organism characterized by two key physiological processes: activation of metabolism upon exiting dormancy and polar tube growth. In gymnosperms and flowering plants, these processes occur in different time frames and exhibit important features; identification of similarities and differences is still in the active phase. In angiosperms, the growth of male gametophyte is directed and controlled by its microenvironment, while in gymnosperms it is relatively autonomous. Recent reviews have detailed aspects of interaction between angiosperm female tissues and pollen such as interactions between peptides and their receptors; however, accumulated evidence suggests low-molecular communication, in particular, through ion exchange and ROS production, equally important for polar growth as well as for pollen germination. Recently, it became clear that ROS and ionic currents form a single regulatory module, since ROS production and the activity of ion transport systems are closely interrelated and form a feedback loop.

"Spatiotemporal Distribution and Species Composition of Fish Assemblages in the Transitional Zone of the Three Gorges Reservoir, China","The river–reservoir transitional zones play an important role in maintaining riverine fish biodiversity and abundance in highly regulated rivers. The Upper Yangtze River, which contains 286 fish species, is experiencing intense hydropower development. However, few studies have been conducted on the spatial distribution of fish in the river–reservoir transitional zones in the Upper Yangtze River, and it is therefore difficult to predict how this development will impact the region. In this study, a 200-kHz split-beam acoustic system in combination with biological samplings was used to investigate the composition and spatiotemporal distribution of the fish in the transition zone of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in 2017. The biological samplings comprised 7434 individuals from 61 species, 38 genera, 15 families, and 5 orders. The dominant fish species were Rhinogobio cylindricus, Coreius guichenoti, Hemiculter bleekeri, and Pelteobagrus vachelli. Acoustic detection identified the mean target strength (TS) to be -55.6 in May, -57.8 in August, and -55.8 dB in December. Accordingly, the average fish density was 4.96, 6.96, and 4.42 ind/1000 m3. Significant differences were found in the TS and fish density between flood season (August) and non-flood season (May and December). Spatially, fish preferred the meandering sections at 10–20 m deep. A size-dependent vertical distribution pattern was observed, with larger fish in the deeper layers and smaller fish in shallower waters. Lastly, our results suggest that meandering deep channels should be assigned high priority with respect to fish conservation in the Upper Yangtze River. "
"Pelvic Girdle Pain, Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder and Hypermobility-Type Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome: A Narrative Literature Review","Pelvic girdle pain (PGP) refers specifically to musculoskeletal pain localised to the pelvic ring and can be present at its anterior and/or posterior aspects. Causes such as trauma, infection and pregnancy have been well-established, while patients with hypermobile joints are at greater risk of developing PGP. Research exploring this association is limited and of varying quality. In the present study we report on the incidence, pathophysiology, diagnostic and treatment modalities for PGP in patients suffering from Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder (HSD) and Hypermobility-Type Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hEDS). Recommendations are made for clinical practice by elaborating on screening, diagnosis and management of such patients to provide a holistic approach to their care. It appears that this cohort of patients are at greater risk particularly of mental health issues. Moreover over, they may require a multidisciplinary approach for their management. Ongoing research is still required to expand our understanding of the relationship between PGP, HSD and hEDS by appropriately diagnosing patients using the latest updated terminologies and by conducting randomised control trials to compare outcomes of interventions using standardised patient reported outcome measures.

"Design and Characterisation of Inhibitory Peptides against Bleg1_2478, an Evolutionary Divergent B3 Metallo–lactamase","Previously, a hypothetical protein (HP) termed Bleg1_2437 (currently named Bleg1_2478) from Bacillus lehensis G1 was discovered to be an evolutionary divergent B3 subclass metallo–lactamase (MBL). Due to the scarcity of clinical inhibitors for B3 MBLs and the divergent nature of Bleg1_2478, this study aimed to design and characterise peptides as inhibitors against Bleg1_2478. Through in silico docking, RSWPWH and SSWWDR peptides with comparable binding energy to ampicillin were obtained. In vitro assay results showed RSWPWH and SSWWDR inhibited the activity of Bleg1_2478 by 50% at concentrations as low as 0.90 M and 0.50 M, respectively. At 10 M of RSWPWH and 20 M of SSWWDR, the activity of Bleg1_2478 was almost completely inhibited. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analyses showed slightly improved binding properties of the peptides compared to ampicillin. Docked peptide–protein complexes revealed that RSWPWH bound near the vicinity of the Bleg1_2478 active site while SSWWDR bound at the center of the active site itself. We postulate that the peptides caused the inhibition of Bleg1_2478 by reducing or blocking the accessibility of its active site from ampicillin, thus hampering its catalytic function. "

Design of Tunable Holographic Liquid Crystalline Diffraction Gratings,"Tunable diffraction gratings and phase filters are important functional devices in optical communication and sensing systems. Polarization gratings, in particular, capable of redirecting an incident light beam completely into the first diffraction orders may be successfully fabricated in liquid crystalline cells assembled from substrates coated with uniform transparent electrodes and orienting layers that force a specific molecular distribution. In this work, the diffraction properties of liquid crystal (LC) cells characterized by a continually rotating cycloidal director pattern at the cell substrates and in the bulk, are studied theoretically by solving a relevant set of the Euler-Lagrange equations. The electric tunability of the gratings is analyzed by estimating the changes in liquid crystalline molecular distribution and thus in effective birefringence, as a function of external voltage. To the best of our knowledge, such detailed numerical calculations have not been presented so far for liquid crystal polarization gratings showing a cycloidal director pattern. Our theoretical predictions may be easily achieved in experimental conditions when exploiting, for example, photo-orienting material, to induce a permanent LC alignment with high spatial resolution. The proposed design may be for example, used as a tunable passband filter with adjustable bandwidths, thus allowing for potential applications in optical spectroscopy, optical communication networks, remote sensing and beyond.

Multi-Scale Shape Adaptive Network for Raindrop Detection and Removal from a Single Image,"Removing raindrops from a single image is a challenging problem due to the complex changes in shape, scale, and transparency among raindrops. Previous explorations have mainly been limited in two ways. First, publicly available raindrop image datasets have limited capacity in terms of modeling raindrop characteristics (e.g., raindrop collision and fusion) in real-world scenes. Second, recent deraining methods tend to apply shape-invariant filters to cope with diverse rainy images and fail to remove raindrops that are especially varied in shape and scale. In this paper, we address these raindrop removal problems from two perspectives. First, we establish a large-scale dataset named RaindropCityscapes, which includes 11,583 pairs of raindrop and raindrop-free images, covering a wide variety of raindrops and background scenarios. Second, a two-branch Multi-scale Shape Adaptive Network (MSANet) is proposed to detect and remove diverse raindrops, effectively filtering the occluded raindrop regions and keeping the clean background well-preserved. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant improvements over the recent state-of-the-art raindrop removal methods. Moreover, the extension of our method towards the rainy image segmentation and detection tasks validates the practicality of the proposed method in outdoor applications. "

Cognitive Conflict in Borderline Personality Disorder: A Study Protocol,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) represents a severe mental condition that is usually characterized by distressing identity disturbances. Although most prevailing explanatory models and psychotherapy approaches consider and intervene on self-concept, they seem not to recognize or explore idiosyncratic cognitive conflicts that patients may experience. These conflicts, which have been conceptualized as “implicative dilemmas” and “dilemmatic constructs” by personal construct theorists, could be considered as key elements of the explanatory model for BPD to provide a better understanding of this disorder and possibly enhance the effectiveness of contemporary psychotherapeutic approaches. The current study (Identifier: NCT04498104) aims to examine the characteristics of the interpersonal cognitive system of a group of patients diagnosed with BPD, using the repertory grid technique, and to compare them with those of a community sample. We will test if BPD participants are more affected by cognitive conflicts than controls. Additionally, we will gauge the association between cognitive conflicts and symptom severity as well as their predictive capacity of treatment outcome. The obtained results will be a necessary step to determine if cognitive conflicts have a substantial role on the explanation of BPD. It could also help to consider the development of a conflict resolution intervention module for this disorder. "
An UML Based Performance Evaluation of Real-Time Systems Using Timed Petri Net," Performance is a critical non-functional parameter for real-time systems and performance analysis is an important task making it more challenging for complex real-time systems. Mostly performance analysis is performed after the system development but an early stage analysis and validation of performance using system models can improve the system quality. In this paper, we present an early stage automated performance evaluation methodology to analyse system performance using the UML sequence diagram model annotated with modeling and analysis of real-time and embedded systems (MARTE) profile. MARTE offers a performance domain sub-profile that is used for representing real-time system properties essential for performance evaluation. In this paper, a transformation technique and transformation rules are proposed to map the UML sequence diagram model into a Generalized Stochastic Timed Petri net model. All the transformation rules are implemented using a metamodel based approach and Atlas Transformation Language (ATL). A case study from the manufacturing domain a Kanban system is used for validating the proposed technique. "
The Influence of Nanoparticles’ Conductivity and Charging on Dielectric Properties of Ester Oil Based Nanofluid,"This study addresses the effect of nanoparticles’ conductivity and surface charge on the dielectric performance of insulating nanofluids. Dispersions of alumina and silicon carbide nanoparticles of similar size (~50 nm) and concentration (0.004% w/w) were prepared in natural ester oil. The stability of the dispersions was explored by dynamic light scattering. AC, positive and negative lightning impulse breakdown voltage, as well as partial discharge inception voltage of the nanofluid samples were measured and compared with the respective properties of the base oil. The obtained results indicate that the addition of SiC nanoparticles can lead to an increase in AC breakdown voltage and also enhance the resistance of the liquid to the appearance of partial discharge. On the other hand, the induction of positive charge from the Al2O3 nanoparticles could be the main factor leading to an improved positive Lightning Impulse Breakdown Voltage and worse performance at negative polarity.

Fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3-Independent Dendritic Cells Are Major Mediators of Th2 Immune Responses in Allergen-Induced Asthmatic Mice,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are the main mediators of Th2 immune responses in allergic asthma, and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L) is an important growth factor for the development and homeostasis of DCs. This study identified the DC populations that primarily cause the initiation and development of allergic lung inflammation using Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) knockout (KO) mice with allergen-induced allergic asthma. We observed type 2 allergic lung inflammation with goblet cell hyperplasia in Flt3 KO mice, despite a significant reduction in total DCs, particularly CD103+ DCs, which was barely detected. In addition, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) from Flt3 KO mice directed Th2 immune responses in vitro, and the adoptive transfer of these BMDCs exacerbated allergic asthma with more marked Th2 responses than that of BMDCs from wild-type (WT) mice. Furthermore, we found that Flt3L regulated the in vitro expression of OX40 ligand (OX40L) in DCs, which is correlated with DC phenotype in in vivo models. In conclusion, we revealed that Flt3-independent CD11b+ DCs direct Th2 responses with the elevated OX40L and are the primary cause of allergic asthma. Our findings suggest that Flt3 is required to control type 2 allergic inflammation. "
The Diagnostic and Therapeutic Role of Leptin and Its Receptor ObR in Glioblastoma Multiforme,"Leptin has been recognized as a potential tumor growth promoter in various cancers including cranial tumor pathologies such as pituitary adenomas, meningiomas and gliomas. Despite recent advances in adjunctive therapy and the established surgical resection, chemo- and radiotherapy regimen, glioblastoma multiforme remains a particular diagnostic and therapeutic challenge among the intracranial tumor pathologies, with a poor long-term prognosis. Systemic inflammation and immune-metabolic signaling through diverse pathways are thought to impact the genesis and recurrence of brain tumors, and glioblastoma multiforme in particular. Among the various circulating mediators, leptin has gained especial diagnostic and therapeutic interest, although the precise relationship between leptin and glioblastoma biology remains largely unknown. In this narrative review (MEDLINE/OVID, SCOPUS, PubMed and manual searches of the bibliographies of known primary and review articles), we discuss the current literature using the following search terms: leptin, glioblastoma multiforme, carcinogenesis, immunometabolism, biomarkers, metformin, antidiabetic medication and metabolic disorders. An increasing body of experimental evidence implicates a relationship between the development and maintenance of gliomas (and brain tumors in general) with a dysregulated central and peripheral immune-metabolic network mediated by circulating adipokines, chemokines and cellular components, and in particular the leptin adipokine. In this review, we summarize the current evidence of the role of leptin in glioblastoma pathophysiology. In addition, we describe the status of alternative diagnostic tools and adjunctive therapeutics targeting leptin, leptin-receptors, antidiabetic drugs and associated pathways. Further experimental and clinical trials are needed to elucidate the mechanism of action and the value of immune-metabolism molecular phenotyping (central and peripheral) in order to develop novel adjunctive diagnostics and therapeutics for newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma patients.

Waveform Design for Space–Time Coded MIMO Systems with High Secrecy Protection ,"In this paper, we present a new secrecy-enhancing scheme for multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) systems using a space–time coding scheme. We adopt a quasi-orthogonal space–time block coding (QO-STBC) scheme that was originally designed to improve the performance of the MIMO system, and propose an efficient waveform design that can enhance the secrecy, as well as improve the error rate performance. Channel- and signal-dependent artificial interference (AI) is added to the proposed waveform, so that only a legitimate receiver can successfully retrieve information. We investigate the secrecy capacity of the proposed scheme, and demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides highly enhanced secrecy performance, compared to the conventional schemes. The performance simulation results reveal that the transmitted information can be properly extracted only at the legitimate receiver.  "
Management of Radial Nerve Lesions after Trauma or Iatrogenic Nerve Injury: Autologous Grafts and Neurolysis,"Background: Proximal radial nerve lesions located between the brachial plexus and its division into the superficial and deep branches are rare but severe injuries. The majority of these lesions occur in association with humerus fractures, directly during trauma or later during osteosynthesis for fracture treatment. Diagnostics and surgical interventions are often delayed. The best type of surgical treatment and the outcome to be expected often is uncertain.

"Global Autozygosity Is Associated with Cancer Risk, Mutational Signature and Prognosis","Global autozygosity quantifies the genome-wide levels of homozygous and heterozygous variants. It is the signature of non-random reproduction, though it can also be driven by other factors, and has been used to assess risk in various diseases. However, the association between global autozygosity and cancer risk has not been studied. From 4057 cancer subjects and 1668 healthy controls, we found strong associations between global autozygosity and risk in ten different cancer types. For example, the heterozygosity ratio was found to be significantly associated with breast invasive carcinoma in Blacks and with male skin cutaneous melanoma in Caucasians. We also discovered eleven associations between global autozygosity and mutational signatures which can explain a portion of the etiology. Furthermore, four significant associations for heterozygosity ratio were revealed in disease-specific survival analyses. This study demonstrates that global autozygosity is effective for cancer risk assessment. "
Bibliometric Analysis of Literature Published on Antibacterial Dental Adhesive from 1996–2020,"This study aimed to investigate the current state of research on antibacterial dental adhesives. The interest in this field can be drawn from an increasing number of scholarly works in this area. However, there is still a lack of quantitative measurement of this topic. The main aim of this study was to consolidate the research published on the antibacterial adhesive from 1996 to 2020 in Web of Science indexed journals. The bibliometric method, a quantitative study of investigating publishing trends and patterns, was used for this study. The result has shown that a gradual increase in research was found, whereby a substantial increase was observed from 2013. A total of 248 documents were published in 84 journals with total citations of 5107. The highly cited articles were published mainly in Q1 category journals. Most of the published articles were from the USA, China, and other developed countries; however, some developing countries contributed as well. The authorship pattern showed an interdisciplinary and collaborative approach among researchers. The thematic evaluation of keywords along with a three-factor analysis showed that ‘antibacterial adhesives’ and ‘quaternary ammonium’ have been used commonly. This bibliometric analysis can provide direction not only to researchers but also to funding organizations and policymakers. "
Metformin Protects against Podocyte Injury in Diabetic Kidney Disease,"Metformin is the most commonly prescribed drug for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Its mechanisms of action have been under extensive investigation, revealing that it has multiple cellular targets, either direct or indirect ones, via which it regulates numerous cellular pathways. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD), the serious complication of T2D, develops in up to 50% of the individuals with T2D. Various mechanisms contribute to the development of DKD, including hyperglycaemia, dyslipidemia, oxidative stress, chronic low-grade inflammation, altered autophagic activity and insulin resistance, among others. Metformin has been shown to affect these pathways, and thus, it could slow down or prevent the progression of DKD. Despite several animal studies demonstrating the renoprotective effects of metformin, there is no concrete evidence in clinical settings. This review summarizes the renoprotective effects of metformin in experimental settings. Special emphasis is on the effects of metformin on podocytes, the glomerular epithelial cells that are central in maintaining the glomerular ultrafiltration function. "
Reinforced Superhydrophobic Anti-Corrosion Epoxy Resin Coating by Fluorine–Silicon–Carbide Composites,"SiC was modified by fluorine-containing organic substance 1H,1H,2H,2H-trifluoro- noctyltriethoxysilane (FAS) to change its hydrophilicity from hydrophilic to superhydrophobic nanoparticles, and the optimum conditions for hydrophobicity were effectively explored. Then, different content of fluorine-modified SiC (F–SiC) nanoparticles were added to the epoxy resin (EP) matrix to prepare composite coating samples. The results showed that the surface of SiC was modified by FAS to show superhydrophobicity, and the dispersion in EP was significantly improved. After adding F–SiC, the hydrophobicity, wear resistance and corrosion resistance of the coating were significantly improved. In addition, the corrosion resistance of the composite coating containing different contents of F–SiC was analyzed through electrochemical and salt spray tests. The results showed that the corrosion resistance of the coating was the best when the addition amount was 3 wt %. In general, the composite coating with 3 wt % F–SiC had the best overall performance. Compared with the EP coating, the water contact angle of 3 wt % F–SiC/EP composite coating was increased by 62.9%, the friction coefficient was reduced by 73.5%, and the corrosion current was reduced by three orders of magnitude. This study provides a new idea for the development of ultra-wear-resistant and anti-fouling heavy-duty coatings. "
Evaluation of Volatilomic Fingerprint from Apple Fruits to Ciders: A Useful Tool to Find Putative Biomarkers for Each Apple Variety,"Aroma is a crucial criterion to assess the quality of apple fruits, juices, and ciders. The aim of this study was to explore similarities and differences in volatile profiles among apple fruits, juices, and ciders from different apple varieties (Festa, Branco, and Domingos) by headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (HS–SPME/GC–MS). A total of 142 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were identified, but only 9 were common in all analysed matrices and apple-tested varieties. Esters, alcohols, and aldehydes presented a higher concentration in apple fruits and juices, whereas esters, alcohols, and acids were dominant in ciders. Moreover, there were unique VOCs for each matrix and for each variety, highlighting the importance of the selection of apple varieties as an important factor to obtain good sensory and quality ciders, multiple benefits, and legal protection against the misuse of local products.

"Comparative Study of Induction Motors of IE2, IE3 and IE4 Efficiency Classes in Pump Applications Taking into Account CO2 Emission Intensity","The high energy intensity of the modern industry and the threat of climate change determine the high urgency of increasing the energy efficiency of electric motors. In this paper, energy consumption, energy costs, payback periods, and CO2 emissions of 75 kW, 4 pole induction motors with direct grid supply in a fixed-speed pump unit are evaluated. Motors of the IE2, IE3, and IE4 efficiency classes according to IEC 60034-30-1 standard are compared in terms of life-time energy savings, payback period, and CO2 emissions. To carry out the analysis, polynomial interpolation of the data from the available manufacturer datasheets of the motors is used. It concluded that even though the initial investment cost of the IE4-motor is higher than that of IE3-motor, the IE4-motor is more profitable if more than 3 years of operation are considered and also provides significant reductions of CO2 emissions. The paper presents a calculation method of the aforementioned indicators which can be useful for companies, researchers, and engineers for quick assessment and selection of technical solutions. "
Role of Natural Killer Cells in Uveal Melanoma,"Uveal melanoma has a high mortality rate following metastasis to the liver. Despite advances in systemic immune therapy, treatment of metastatic uveal melanoma (MUM) has failed to achieve long term durable responses. Barriers to success with immune therapy include the immune regulatory nature of uveal melanoma as well as the immune tolerant environment of the liver. To adequately harness the anti-tumor potential of the immune system, non-T cell-based approaches need to be explored. Natural Killer (NK) cells possess potent ability to target tumor cells via innate and adaptive responses. In this review, we discuss evidence that highlights the role of NK cell surveillance and targeting of uveal melanoma. We also discuss the repertoire of intra-hepatic NK cells. The human liver has a vast and diverse lymphoid population and NK cells comprise 50% of the hepatic lymphocytes. Hepatic NK cells share a common niche with uveal melanoma micro-metastasis within the liver sinusoids. It is, therefore, crucial to understand and investigate the role of intra-hepatic NK cells in the control or progression of MUM. "
Is Interleukin 17 (IL-17) Expression A Common Point in the Pathogenesis of Depression and Obesity?,"(1) Background: Activated immune-inflammatory pathways play an important role in the pathogenesis of depression and pathological obesity. Obesity might promote production of cytokine interleukin 17, which plays a significant role in neuro-immune reactions. The study aimed at assessing the relationship between Body Mass Index (BMI) and IL-17 expression, taking into account the clinical psychiatric variables in patients with depression. (2) Methods: A total of 125 participants took part in the study (95 depressed patients, 30 healthy controls). Data concerning the course of depressive disorders and BMI were collected. The severity of depressive symptoms was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to assess IL-17 gene expression at the mRNA levels, while enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to assess IL-17 expression at the protein level. (3) Results: Patients with more hospitalizations showed significantly higher IL-17 mRNA expression levels and higher BMI. However, no correlation between BMI and IL-17 expression was found in depressed patients. (4) Conclusions: Our study revealed that BMI does not affect IL-17 expression in patients with depression. However, further studies should be conducted to evaluate the effects of IL-17 inhibition on adipose tissue and vice versa. "
Equation Based New Methods for Residential Load Forecasting,"This work proposes two non-linear and one linear equation-based system for residential load forecasting considering heating degree days, cooling degree days, occupancy, and day type, which are applicable to any residential building with small sets of smart meter data. The coefficients of the proposed nonlinear and linear equations are tuned by particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the multiple linear regression method, respectively. For the purpose of comparison, a subtractive clustering based adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), random forests, gradient boosting trees, and long-term short memory neural network, conventional and modified support vector regression methods were considered. Simulations have been performed in MATLAB environment, and all the methods were tested with randomly chosen 30 days data of a residential building in Memphis City for energy consumption prediction. The absolute average error, root mean square error, and mean average percentage errors are tabulated and considered as performance indices. The efficacy of the proposed systems for residential load forecasting over the other systems have been validated by both simulation results and performance indices, which indicate that the proposed equation-based systems have the lowest absolute average errors, root mean square errors, and mean average percentage errors compared to the other methods. In addition, the proposed systems can be easily practically implemented. "

Performance of Three Different Native Plant Mixtures for Extensive Green Roofs in a Humid Subtropical Climate Context,"Most of the services and benefits of green roofs are related to the substrate as well as the vegetation layer. Although plant selection should be made on the basis of green roof typology, morphology, and climate conditions, very often, Sedum species only are used worldwide. However, they do not always guarantee the best performances; hence, it is important to investigate different plant species and their performance in different climate contexts. Herein, an experiment was conducted using three plant mixes (i.e., a Sedum mix, a perennial herbaceous mix, and a suffruticose mix), grown in boxes containing two substrates (a volcanic substrate or a recycled crushed brick substrate) and two drainage/storage layers (a preformed layer or a mineral layer), in factorial combination. The Sedum mix showed a high canopy cover, comparable to or even higher than that of the other mixes, particularly when supplemental irrigation was stopped. However, the actual crop coefficient (Kc act) of the herbaceous and suffruticose mixes was often higher than that of the Sedum mix. The results also showed that both the substrate and the drainage/storage layer may improve Kc act values as a consequence of their capacity for stormwater retention. "
Comprehensive Analysis Reveals Novel Interactions between Circulating MicroRNAs and Gut Microbiota Composition in Human Obesity,"Background: The determinants that mediate the interactions between microRNAs and the gut microbiome impacting on obesity are scarcely understood. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate possible interactions between circulating microRNAs and gut microbiota composition in obesity. Method: The sample comprised 78 subjects with obesity (cases, body mass index (BMI): 30–40 kg/m2) and 25 eutrophic individuals (controls, BMI  25 kg/m2). The expression of 96 microRNAs was investigated in plasma of all individuals using miRCURY LNA miRNA Custom PCR Panels. Bacterial DNA sequencing was performed following the Illumina 16S protocol. The FDR correction was used for multiple comparison analyses. Results: A total of 26 circulating microRNAs and 12 bacterial species were found differentially expressed between cases and controls. Interestingly, an interaction among three miRNAs (miR-130b-3p, miR-185-5p and miR-21-5p) with Bacteroides eggerthi and BMI levels was evidenced (r2 "
Blended Natural Support Materials—Collagen Based Hydrogels Used in Biomedicine,"Due to their unique properties—the are biocompatible, easily accessible, and inexpensive with programmable properties—biopolymers are used in pharmaceutical and biomedical research, as well as in cosmetics and food. Collagen is one of the most-used biomaterials in biomedicine, being the most abundant protein in animals with a triple helices structure, biocompatible, biomimetic, biodegradable, and hemostatic. Its disadvantages are its poor mechanical and thermal properties and enzymatic degradation. In order to solve this problem and to use its benefits, collagen can be used blended with other biomaterials such as alginate, chitosan, and cellulose. The purpose of this review article is to offer a brief paper with updated information on blended collagen-based formulations and their potential application in biomedicine. "
Real-Time Monitoring for Hydraulic States Based on Convolutional Bidirectional LSTM with Attention Mechanism,"By monitoring a hydraulic system using artificial intelligence, we can detect anomalous data in a manufacturing workshop. In addition, by analyzing the anomalous data, we can diagnose faults and prevent failures. However, artificial intelligence, especially deep learning, needs to learn much data, and it is often difficult to get enough data at the real manufacturing site. In this paper, we apply augmentation to increase the amount of data. In addition, we propose real-time monitoring based on a deep-learning model that uses convergence of a convolutional neural network (CNN), a bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM), and an attention mechanism. CNN extracts features from input data, and BiLSTM learns feature information. The learned information is then fed to the sigmoid classifier to find out if it is normal or abnormal. Experimental results show that the proposed model works better than other deep-learning models, such as CNN or long short-term memory (LSTM). "
Prospects for NK Cell Therapy of Sarcoma,"Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphoid cells with potent antitumor activity. One of the most NK cell cytotoxicity-sensitive tumor types is sarcoma, an aggressive mesenchyme-derived neoplasm. While a combination of radical surgery and radio- and chemotherapy can successfully control local disease, patients with advanced sarcomas remain refractory to current treatment regimens, calling for novel therapeutic strategies. There is accumulating evidence for NK cell-mediated immunosurveillance of sarcoma cells during all stages of the disease, highlighting the potential of using NK cells as a therapeutic tool. However, sarcomas display multiple immunoevasion mechanisms that can suppress NK cell function leading to an uncontrolled tumor outgrowth. Here, we review the current evidence for NK cells’ role in immune surveillance of sarcoma during disease initiation, promotion, progression, and metastasis, as well as the molecular mechanisms behind sarcoma-mediated NK cell suppression. Further, we apply this basic understanding of NK–sarcoma crosstalk in order to identify and summarize the most promising candidates for NK cell-based sarcoma immunotherapy. "
Liposomes Targeting P21 Activated Kinase-1 (PAK-1) and Selective for Secretory Phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) Decrease Cell Viability and Induce Apoptosis in Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells,"P21 activated kinases (or group I PAKs) are serine/threonine kinases whose expression is altered in prostate and breast cancers. PAK-1 activity is inhibited by the small molecule “Inhibitor targeting PAK-1 activation-3” (IPA-3), which has selectivity for PAK-1 but is metabolically unstable. Secretory Group IIA phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) expression correlates to increased metastasis and decreased survival in many cancers. We previously designed novel liposomal formulations targeting both PAK-1 and sPLA2, called Secretory Phospholipase Responsive liposomes or SPRL-IPA-3, and demonstrated their ability to alter prostate cancer growth. The efficacy of SPRL against other types of cancers is not well understood. We addressed this limitation by determining the ability of SPRL to induce cell death in a diverse panel of cells representing different stages of breast cancer, including the invasive but non-metastatic MCF-7 cells, and metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells such as MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB-435. We investigated the role of sPLA2 in the disposition of these liposomes by comparing the efficacy of SPRL-IPA-3 to IPA-3 encapsulated in sterically stabilized liposomes (SSL-IPA-3), a formulation shown to be less sensitive to sPLA2. Both SSL-IPA-3 and SPRL-IPA-3 induced time- and dose-dependent decreases in MTT staining in all cell lines tested, but SPRL-IPA-3-induced effects in metastatic TNBC cell lines were superior over SSL-IPA-3. The reduction in MTT staining induced by SPRL-IPA-3 correlated to the expression of Group IIA sPLA2. sPLA2 expression also correlated to increased induction of apoptosis in TNBC cell lines by SPRL-IPA-3. These data suggest that SPRL-IPA-3 is selective for metastatic TNBC cells and that the efficacy of SPRL-IPA-3 is mediated, in part, by the expression of Group IIA sPLA2. "
Genome-Wide Novel Genic Microsatellite Marker Resource Development and Validation for Genetic Diversity and Population Structure Analysis of Banana,"Trait tagging through molecular markers is an important molecular breeding tool for crop improvement. SSR markers encoded by functionally relevant parts of a genome are well suited for this task because they may be directly related to traits. However, a limited number of these markers are known for Musa spp. Here, we report 35136 novel functionally relevant SSR markers (FRSMs). Among these, 17,561, 15,373 and 16,286 FRSMs were mapped in-silico to the genomes of Musa acuminata, M. balbisiana and M. schizocarpa, respectively. A set of 273 markers was validated using eight accessions of Musa spp., from which 259 markers (95%) produced a PCR product of the expected size and 203 (74%) were polymorphic. In-silico comparative mapping of FRSMs onto Musa and related species indicated sequence-based orthology and synteny relationships among the chromosomes of Musa and other plant species. Fifteen FRSMs were used to estimate the phylogenetic relationships among 50 banana accessions, and the results revealed that all banana accessions group into two major clusters according to their genomic background. Here, we report the first large-scale development and characterization of functionally relevant Musa SSR markers. We demonstrate their utility for germplasm characterization, genetic diversity studies, and comparative mapping in Musa spp. and other monocot species. The sequences for these novel markers are freely available via a searchable web interface called Musa Marker Database. "
An Integrated Pharmacophore/Docking/3D-QSAR Approach to Screening a Large Library of Products in Search of Future Botulinum Neurotoxin A Inhibitors,"Botulinum toxins are neurotoxins produced by Clostridium botulinum. This toxin can be lethal for humans as a cause of botulism; however, in small doses, the same toxin is used to treat different conditions. Even if the therapeutic doses are effective and safe, the adverse reactions could be local and could unmask a subclinical impairment of neuromuscular transmissions. There are not many cases of adverse events in the literature; however, it is possible that sometimes they do not occur as they are transient and, if they do occur, there is no possibility of a cure other than to wait for the pharmacological effect to end. Inhibition of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) effects is a strategy for treating botulism as it can provide an effective post-exposure remedy. In this paper, 13,592,287 compounds were screened through a pharmacophore filter, a 3D-QSAR model, and a virtual screening; then, the compounds with the best affinity were selected. Molecular dynamics simulation studies on the first four compounds predicted to be the most active were conducted to verify that the poses foreseen by the docking were stable. This approach allowed us to identify compounds with a calculated inhibitory activity in the range of 316–500 nM. "

Sustainability in FinTechs: An Explanation through Business Model Scalability and Market Valuation,"Framework: Financial Technology (FinTech) is an industry composed of diversified firms that combine financial services with innovative technologies. The research question and main goal are attempting to answer whether they are more similar to traditional banks or trendy technological firms deploying their innovativeness to favor financial inclusion and sustainability. Justification: Evaluators may wonder if FinTechs follow the typical evaluation patterns of bank/financial intermediaries or those of technological firms. Preliminary empirical evidence shows that the latter interpretation is the one consistent with the stock-market mood. Objective: This study goes beyond the extant literature, analyzing the differences between FinTechs and traditional banks in market valuation, and showing the potential for digital interaction and cross-pollination of complementary business models. Methodology: The differences will be empirically analyzed with the stock market valuation and the multipliers associated with these firms. Results: The main contribution of this paper is that the appraisal approaches of FinTechs follow those of technological startups, having a revenue model much more scalable than that of a typical bank. FinTechs may so provide a solution for sustainable finance with microfinance and crowdfunding among others. FinTechs and traditional banks may eventually converge towards a common market exploiting co-opetition strategies. "
Implications of Metastable Nicks and Nicked Holliday Junctions in Processing Joint Moleculesin Mitosis and Meiosis,"Joint molecules (JMs) are intermediates of homologous recombination (HR). JMs rejoin sister or homolog chromosomes and must be removed timely to allow segregation in anaphase. Current models pinpoint Holliday junctions (HJs) as a central JM. The canonical HJ (cHJ) is a four-way DNA that needs specialized nucleases, a.k.a. resolvases, to resolve into two DNA molecules. Alternatively, a helicase–topoisomerase complex can deal with pairs of cHJs in the dissolution pathway. Aside from cHJs, HJs with a nick at the junction (nicked HJ; nHJ) can be found in vivo and are extremely good substrates for resolvases in vitro. Despite these findings, nHJs have been neglected as intermediates in HR models. Here, I present a conceptual study on the implications of nicks and nHJs in the final steps of HR. I address this from a biophysical, biochemical, topological, and genetic point of view. My conclusion is that they ease the elimination of JMs while giving genetic directionality to the final products. Additionally, I present an alternative view of the dissolution pathway since the nHJ that results from the second end capture predicts a cross-join isomerization. Finally, I propose that this isomerization nicely explains the strict crossover preference observed in synaptonemal-stabilized JMs in meiosis. "
Treatment of Electroplating Wastewater Using NF pH-Stable Membranes: Characterization and Application,"Industrial adoption of nanofiltration (NF) for treatment of low-pH wastewater is hindered by the limited membrane lifetime at strongly acidic conditions. In this study, the electroplating wastewater (EPWW) filtration performance of a novel pH-stable NF membrane is compared against a commercial NF membrane and a reverse osmosis (RO) membrane. The presented membrane is relatively hydrophobic and has its isoelectric point (IEP) at pH 4.1, with a high and positive zeta potential of +10 mV at pH 3. A novel method was developed to determine the molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) at a pH of 2, with a finding that the membrane maintains the same MWCO (~500 Da) as under neutral pH operating conditions, whereas the commercial membrane significantly increases it. In crossflow filtration experiments with simulated EPWW, rejections above 75% are observed for all heavy metals (compared to only 30% of the commercial membrane), while keeping the same pH in the feed and permeate. Despite the relatively lower permeance of the prepared membrane (~1 L/(m2hbar) versus ~4 L/(m2hbar) of the commercial membrane), its high heavy metals rejection coupled with a very low acid rejection makes it suitable for acid recovery applications.

Reconstructing Nonparametric Productivity Networks,"Network models provide a general representation of inter-connected system dynamics. This ability to connect systems has led to a proliferation of network models for economic productivity analysis, primarily estimated non-parametrically using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). While network DEA models can be used to measure system performance, they lack a statistical framework for inference, due in part to the complex structure of network processes. We fill this gap by developing a general framework to infer the network structure in a Bayesian sense, in order to better understand the underlying relationships driving system performance. Our approach draws on recent advances in information science, machine learning and statistical inference from the physics of complex systems to estimate unobserved network linkages. To illustrate, we apply our framework to analyze the production of knowledge, via own and cross-disciplinary research, for a world-country panel of bibliometric data. We find significant interactions between related disciplinary research output, both in terms of quantity and quality. In the context of research productivity, our results on cross-disciplinary linkages could be used to better target research funding across disciplines and institutions. More generally, our framework for inferring the underlying network production technology could be applied to both public and private settings which entail spillovers, including intra- and inter-firm managerial decisions and public agency coordination. This framework also provides a systematic approach to model selection when the underlying network structure is unknown. "

The Effect of Trust on the Various Dimensions of Climate Change Attitudes,"The struggle against climate change will not be successful without a sufficient level of collective action. However, a necessary precondition for this is the existence of trust between people. The literature on trust and attitudes to climate change is displaying a growing tendency, and today the results of numerous empirical studies are available. Although, for the time being, on the basis of these studies, we only have a fragmented picture from which it appears that trust is having a significant effect on attitudes to climate change at both the micro and macro levels. The current paper tries to progress on this path and reveal the role of trust in various dimensions of the attitude to climate change using the data of the European Social Survey originating from 22 countries. The results show that while climate change beliefs and climate concern display no relationship with trust, neither on the individual or national level, trust does have a clear effect on the feeling of individual responsibility in connection with climate change and on support for the various policy measures. In addition, it is also investigated whether the effect of trust can be shown to exist in the relationships between climate concern and the feeling of individual responsibility, and climate concern and policy support. The results show that in both cases the relationship is stronger in those countries characterized by a higher level of social trust. "
Non-Thermal Plasma Coupled with Catalyst for the Degradation of Water Pollutants: A Review,"Non-thermal plasma is one of the most promising technologies used for the degradation of hazardous pollutants in wastewater. Recent studies evidenced that various operating parameters influence the yield of the Non-Thermal Plasma (NTP)-based processes. In particular, the presence of a catalyst, suitably placed in the NTP reactor, induces a significant increase in process performance with respect to NTP alone. For this purpose, several researchers have studied the ability of NTP coupled to catalysts for the removal of different kind of pollutants in aqueous solution. It is clear that it is still complicated to define an optimal condition that can be suitable for all types of contaminants as well as for the various types of catalysts used in this context. However, it was highlighted that the operational parameters play a fundamental role. However, it is often difficult to understand the effect that plasma can induce on the catalyst and on the production of the oxidizing species most responsible for the degradation of contaminants. For this reason, the aim of this review is to summarize catalytic formulations coupled with non-thermal plasma technology for water pollutants removal. In particular, the reactor configuration to be adopted when NTP was coupled with a catalyst was presented, as well as the position of the catalyst in the reactor and the role of the main oxidizing species. Furthermore, in this review, a comparison in terms of degradation and mineralization efficiency was made for the different cases studied. "
Interactive Robot for Playing Russian Checkers,"Human–robot interaction in board games is a rapidly developing field of robotics. This paper presents a robot capable of playing Russian checkers designed for entertaining, training, and research purposes. Its control program is based on a novel unsupervised self-learning algorithm inspired by AlphaZero and represents the first successful attempt of using this approach in the checkers game. The main engineering challenge in mechanics is to develop a board state acquisition system non-sensitive to lighting conditions, which is achieved by rejecting computer vision and utilizing magnetic sensors instead. An original robot face is designed to endow the robot an ability to express its attributed emotional state. Testing the robot at open-air multiday exhibitions shows the robustness of the design to difficult exploitation conditions and the high interest of visitors to the robot. "

Systematic Analysis of the Relative Abundance of Polymers Occurring as Microplastics in Freshwaters and Estuaries,"Despite growing interest in the environmental impact of microplastics, a standardized characterization method is not available. We carried out a systematic analysis of reliable global data detailing the relative abundance of polymers in freshwaters and estuaries. The polymers were identified according to seven main categories: polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyurethane and a final category of miscellaneous plastic. The results show that microplastics comprised of polyvinyl chloride and polyurethane are significantly less abundant than would be expected based on global production, possibly due to their use. This has implications for models of microplastic release into the environment based on production and fate. When analysed by matrix (water, sediment or biota) distinct profiles were obtained for each category. Polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene were more abundant in sediment than in biota, while miscellaneous plastics was more frequent in biota. The data suggest that environmental sorting of microplastic particles, influenced by physical, chemical and biological processes, may play a key role in environmental impact, although partitioning among matrices based on density was not realized. The distinct profile of microplastics in biota raises an important question regarding potential selectivity in uptake by organisms, highlighting the priority for more and better-informed laboratory exposure studies. "
Unusual Faces of Bladder Cancer,"The overwhelming majority of bladder cancers are transitional cell carcinomas. Albeit mostly monotonous, carcinomas in the bladder may occasionally display a broad spectrum of histological features that should be recognized by pathologists because some of them represent a diagnostic problem and/or lead prognostic implications. Sometimes these features are focal in the context of conventional transitional cell carcinomas, but some others are generalized across the tumor making its recognition a challenge. For practical purposes, the review distributes the morphologic spectrum of changes in architecture and cytology. Thus, nested and large nested, micropapillary, myxoid stroma, small tubules and adenoma nephrogenic-like, microcystic, verrucous, and diffuse lymphoepithelioma-like, on one hand, and plasmacytoid, signet ring, basaloid-squamous, yolk-sac, trophoblastic, rhabdoid, lipid/lipoblastic, giant, clear, eosinophilic (oncocytoid), and sarcomatoid, on the other, are revisited. Key histological and immunohistochemical features useful in the differential diagnosis are mentioned. In selected cases, molecular data associated with the diagnosis, prognosis, and/or treatment are also included. "
Xenopus gpx3 Mediates Posterior Development by Regulating Cell Death during Embryogenesis,"Glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx3) belongs to the glutathione peroxidase family of selenoproteins and is a key antioxidant enzyme in multicellular organisms against oxidative damage. Downregulation of GPx3 affects tumor progression and metastasis and is associated with liver and heart disease. However, the physiological significance of GPx3 in vertebrate embryonic development remains poorly understood. The current study aimed to investigate the functional roles of gpx3 during embryogenesis. To this end, we determined gpx3’s spatiotemporal expression using Xenopus laevis as a model organism. Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we demonstrated the zygotic nature of this gene. Interestingly, the expression of gpx3 enhanced during the tailbud stage of development, and whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) analysis revealed gpx3 localization in prospective tail region of developing embryo. gpx3 knockdown using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) resulted in short post-anal tails, and these malformed tails were significantly rescued by glutathione peroxidase mimic ebselen. The gene expression analysis indicated that gpx3 knockdown significantly altered the expression of genes associated with Wnt, Notch, and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways involved in tailbud development. Moreover, RNA sequencing identified that gpx3 plays a role in regulation of cell death in the developing embryo. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and phospho-histone 3 (PH3) staining confirmed the association of gpx3 knockdown with increased cell death and decreased cell proliferation in tail region of developing embryos, establishing the involvement of gpx3 in tailbud development by regulating the cell death. Furthermore, these findings are inter-related with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in gpx3 knockdown embryos, as measured by using a redox-sensitive fluorescent probe HyPer. Taken together, our results suggest that gpx3 plays a critical role in posterior embryonic development by regulating cell death and proliferation during vertebrate embryogenesis. "

"Influence of Nb Content on Precipitation, Grain Microstructure, Texture and Magnetic Properties of Grain-Oriented Silicon Steel","The effects of Nb content on precipitation, microstructure, texture and magnetic properties of primary recrystallized grain-oriented silicon steel were investigated by various methods. The results show that the precipitates in primary recrystallized sheets are mainly MnS, Nb(C,N), composite precipitates of MnS and AlN, and composite precipitates of Nb(C,N) and AlN. Adding niobium could refine the primary recrystallized microstructure. The steel with 0.009 wt% Nb possesses the finest and the most dispersed precipitates, which contributes to the finest primary recrystallized microstructure due to the strong pinning force. Adding niobium is beneficial to obtain large volume fraction favorable texture for grain-oriented silicon steel, and the effect of Nb addition is not obvious when the content is higher than 0.009 wt%. After final annealing, the steel with 0.009 wt% Nb shows the best magnetic properties, B800 "
CLSTM: Deep Feature-Based Speech Emotion Recognition Using the Hierarchical ConvLSTM Network,"Artificial intelligence, deep learning, and machine learning are dominant sources to use in order to make a system smarter. Nowadays, the smart speech emotion recognition (SER) system is a basic necessity and an emerging research area of digital audio signal processing. However, SER plays an important role with many applications that are related to human–computer interactions (HCI). The existing state-of-the-art SER system has a quite low prediction performance, which needs improvement in order to make it feasible for the real-time commercial applications. The key reason for the low accuracy and the poor prediction rate is the scarceness of the data and a model configuration, which is the most challenging task to build a robust machine learning technique. In this paper, we addressed the limitations of the existing SER systems and proposed a unique artificial intelligence (AI) based system structure for the SER that utilizes the hierarchical blocks of the convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) with sequence learning. We designed four blocks of ConvLSTM, which is called the local features learning block (LFLB), in order to extract the local emotional features in a hierarchical correlation. The ConvLSTM layers are adopted for input-to-state and state-to-state transition in order to extract the spatial cues by utilizing the convolution operations. We placed four LFLBs in order to extract the spatiotemporal cues in the hierarchical correlational form speech signals using the residual learning strategy. Furthermore, we utilized a novel sequence learning strategy in order to extract the global information and adaptively adjust the relevant global feature weights according to the correlation of the input features. Finally, we used the center loss function with the softmax loss in order to produce the probability of the classes. The center loss increases the final classification results and ensures an accurate prediction as well as shows a conspicuous role in the whole proposed SER scheme. We tested the proposed system over two standard, interactive emotional dyadic motion capture (IEMOCAP) and ryerson audio visual database of emotional speech and song (RAVDESS) speech corpora, and obtained a 75% and an 80% recognition rate, respectively.

Transition of Serum Cytokine Concentration in Rickettsia japonica Infection,"(1) Background. Rickettsia japonica (R. japonica) infection induces severe inflammation, and the disappearance of eosinophil in the acute stage is one of the phenomena. (2) Materials and Methods. In the current study, we measured the serum concentrations of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines in the acute and recovery stages. (3) Results. In the acute phase, IL-6 and IFN- levels were elevated and we speculated that they played a role as a defense mechanism against R. japonica. The high concentration of IFN- suppressed the differentiation of eosinophil and induced apoptosis of eosinophil, leading to the disappearance of eosinophil. On day 7, IL-6 and IFN- concentrations were decreased, and Th2 cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-9 were slightly increased. On day 14, eosinophil count recovered to the normal level. The transition of serum cytokine concentration in R. japonica infection was presented. (4) Conclusions. IL-6 and IFN- seem to be critical cytokines as defense mechanism against R. japonica in the acute phase, and this may deeply connect to the decrease of eosinophil. "
Analysis of Aircraft Maintenance Related Accidents and Serious Incidents in Nigeria,"The maintenance of aircraft presents considerable challenges to the personnel that maintain them. Challenges such as time pressure, system complexity, sparse feedback, cramped workspaces, etc., are being faced by these personnel on a daily basis. Some of these challenges cause aircraft-maintenance-related accidents and serious incidents. However, there is little formal empirical work that describes the influence of aircraft maintenance to aircraft accidents and incidents in Nigeria. This study, therefore, sets out to explore the contributory factors to aircraft-maintenance-related incidents from 2006 to 2019 and accidents from 2009 to 2019 in Nigeria, to achieve a deeper understanding of this safety critical aspect of the aviation industry, create awareness amongst the relevant stakeholders and seek possible mitigating factors. To attain this, a content analysis of accident reports and mandatory occurrence reports, which occurred in Nigeria, was carried out using the Maintenance Factors and Analysis Classification System (MxFACS) and Hieminga’s maintenance incidents taxonomy. An inter-rater concordance value was used to ascertain research accuracy after evaluation of the data output by subject matter experts. The highest occurring maintenance-related incidents and accidents were attributed to “removal/installation”, working practices such as “accumulation of dirt and contamination”, “inspection/testing”, “inadequate oversight from operator and regulator”, “failure to follow procedures” and “incorrect maintenance”. To identify the root cause of these results, maintenance engineers were consulted via a survey to understand the root causes of these contributory factors. The results of the study revealed that the most common maintenance-related accidents and serious incidents in the last decade are “collision with terrain” and “landing gear events’’. The most frequent failures at systems level resulting in accidents are the “engines” and “airframe structure”. The maintenance factors with the highest contribution to these accidents are “operator and regulatory oversight”, “inadequate inspection” and “failure to follow procedures”. The research also highlights that the highest causal and contributory factors to aviation incidents in Nigeria from 2006 to 2019 are “installation/removal issues”, “inspection/testing issues”, “working practices”, “job close up”, “lubrication and servicing”, all of which corresponds to studies by other researchers in other countries.

Extracellular Vesicles in HTLV-1 Communication: The Story of an Invisible Messenger,"Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infects 5–10 million people worldwide and is the causative agent of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) as well as other inflammatory diseases. A major concern is that the most majority of individuals with HTLV-1 are asymptomatic carriers and that there is limited global attention by health care officials, setting up potential conditions for increased viral spread. HTLV-1 transmission occurs primarily through sexual intercourse, blood transfusion, intravenous drug usage, and breast feeding. Currently, there is no cure for HTLV-1 infection and only limited treatment options exist, such as class I interferons (IFN) and Zidovudine (AZT), with poor prognosis. Recently, small membrane-bound structures, known as extracellular vesicles (EVs), have received increased attention due to their potential to carry viral cargo (RNA and proteins) in multiple pathogenic infections (i.e., human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1), Zika virus, and HTLV-1). In the case of HTLV-1, EVs isolated from the peripheral blood and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of HAM/TSP patients contained the viral transactivator protein Tax. Additionally, EVs derived from HTLV-1-infected cells (HTLV-1 EVs) promote functional effects such as cell aggregation which enhance viral spread. In this review, we present current knowledge surrounding EVs and their potential role as immune-modulating agents in cancer and other infectious diseases such as HTLV-1 and HIV-1. We discuss various features of EVs that make them prime targets for possible vehicles of future diagnostics and therapies. "
"Treatment-Resistant Depression in a Real-World Setting: First Interim Analysis of Characteristics, Healthcare Resource Use, and Utility Values of the FondaMental Cohort","Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is among the most common psychiatric disorders. One-third of patients are usually unresponsive to several lines of treatment. This study aimed to describe the FondaMental French cohort of patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and to estimate utility and healthcare resource use outcomes. Methods: Patients with TRD were evaluated prospectively over four years (baseline, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48 months) in a real-world clinical setting. Interim analyses focused on the first two consecutive years. Four MDD-related states (major depressive episode (MDE), response, remission, recovery) were defined based on the MADRS (Montgomery–Åsberg depression rating scale) and other clinical events. Health status was assessed with the EuroQol 5 Dimensions 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire. Utility values were estimated as preference measures that the patients assigned to their overall health status. Results: This study was based on 252 patients with TRD. The mean utility value by health state was 0.41, 0.63, 0.80, and 0.90, for MDE, response, remission, and recovery, respectively. At baseline, 59% of patients had an MADRS score of at least 28. Their baseline average utility value was lower compared to the other patients (0.43 versus 0.58, p < 0.001). This significant difference persisted at the following visits. The rate of patients in MDEs having at least one hospitalisation for depression or other reasons than depression was generally higher than that in the other health states. Conclusion: This study documented patterns in healthcare resource consumption, quality of life, and other characteristics in patients with TRD, both globally and by health state and depression severity.

Content of Phenolic Compounds and Organic Acids in the Flowers of Selected Tulipa gesneriana Cultivars,"The study focused on the determination of phenolic acids, flavonoids and organic acids in five tulip cultivars ‘Barcelona’, ‘Columbus’, ‘Strong Gold’, ‘Super Parrot’ and ‘Tropicana’. The cultivars grown in field and in a greenhouse were exposed after cutting to different times of storage (0, 3 and 6 days). The phenolic profile contained 4-hydroxybenzoic, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic, gallic, vanillic, syringic, salicylic, protocatechuic, trans-cinnamic, p-coumaric, caffeic, ferulic, chlorogenic and sinapic acids, as well as quercetin, rutin, luteonin, catechin and vitexin. The mean phenolic acid content was in the following order: ‘Columbus’ and ‘Tropicana’ > ’Barcelona’ > ’Strong Gold’ > ’Super Parrot’, while the levels of flavonoids were as follows: ‘Strong Gold’ > ’Barcelona’ > ’Tropicana’ > ’Columbus’ > ’Super Parrot’. The highest content of phenolic acids was confirmed for Columbus and Tropicana, while the lowest was for Super Parrot. However total phenolic content was very similar, observed between the place of cultivation, time of storage and cultivars. Malonic, succinic, acetic and citric acids were the major organic acid components in tulip petals. More organic acids (except malonic) were accumulated in tulip petals from fields than those from the greenhouse, while changes during storage were strictly correlated with cultivars. "
Preclinical Rationale for Targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 Axis in Combination with a CD38 Antibody in Multiple Myeloma and Other CD38-Positive Malignancies,"The CD38-targeting antibody daratumumab mediates its anti-myeloma activities not only through Fc-receptor-dependent effector mechanisms, but also by its effects on T-cell immunity through depletion of CD38+ regulatory T-cells, regulatory B-cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Therefore, combining daratumumab with modulators of other potent immune inhibitory pathways, such as the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, may further improve its efficacy. We show that multiple myeloma (MM) cells from relapsed/refractory patients have increased expression of PD-L1, compared to newly diagnosed patients. Furthermore, PD-1 is upregulated on T-cells from both newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory MM patients, compared to healthy controls. In short-term experiments with bone marrow samples from MM patients, daratumumab-mediated lysis was mainly associated with the MM cells’ CD38 expression levels and the effector (NK-cells/monocytes/T-cells)-to-target ratio, but not with the PD-L1 expression levels or PD-1+ T-cell frequencies. Although PD-1 blockade with nivolumab did not affect MM cell viability or enhanced daratumumab-mediated lysis in short-term ex vivo experiments, nivolumab resulted in a mild but clear increase in T-cell numbers. Moreover, with a longer treatment duration, PD-1 blockade markedly improved anti-CD38 antibody-mediated cytotoxicity in vivo in murine CD38+ tumor models. In conclusion, dual targeting of CD38 and PD-1 may represent a promising strategy for treating MM and other CD38-positive malignancies. "
Fluorescein Derivatives as Fluorescent Probes for pH Monitoring along Recent Biological Applications,"Potential of hydrogen (pH) is one of the most relevant parameters characterizing aqueous solutions. In biology, pH is intrinsically linked to cellular life since all metabolic pathways are implicated into ionic flows. In that way, determination of local pH offers a unique and major opportunity to increase our understanding of biological systems. Whereas the most common technique to obtain these data in analytical chemistry is to directly measure potential between two electrodes, in biological systems, this information has to be recovered in-situ without any physical interaction. Based on their non-invasive optical properties, fluorescent pH-sensitive probe are pertinent tools to develop. One of the most notorious pH-sensitive probes is fluorescein. In addition to excellent photophysical properties, this fluorophore presents a pH-sensitivity around neutral and physiologic domains. This review intends to shed new light on the recent use of fluorescein as pH-sensitive probes for biological applications, including targeted probes for specific imaging, flexible monitoring of bacterial growth, and biomedical applications.

Behaviour of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells on Amine Plasma-Coated Materials with Various Chemical Structures and Morphologies,"Amine-coated biodegradable materials based on synthetic polymers have a great potential for tissue remodeling and regeneration because of their excellent processability and bioactivity. In the present study, we have investigated the influence of various chemical compositions of amine plasma polymer (PP) coatings and the influence of the substrate morphology, represented by polystyrene culture dishes and polycaprolactone nanofibers (PCL NFs), on the behavior of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Although all amine-PP coatings improved the initial adhesion of VSMCs, 7-day long cultivation revealed a clear preference for the coating containing about 15 at.% of nitrogen (CPA-33). The CPA-33 coating demonstrated the ideal combination of good water stability, a sufficient amine group content, and favorable surface wettability and morphology. The nanostructured morphology of amine-PP-coated PCL NFs successfully slowed the proliferation rate of VSMCs, which is essential in preventing restenosis of vascular replacements in vivo. At the same time, CPA-33-coated PCL NFs supported the continuous proliferation of VSMCs during 7-day long cultivation, with no significant increase in cytokine secretion by RAW 264.7 macrophages. The CPA-33 coating deposited on biodegradable PCL NFs therefore seems to be a promising material for manufacturing small-diameter vascular grafts, which are still lacking on the current market. "
Microfluidic Device for the Analysis of Angiogenic Sprouting under Bidirectional Biochemical Gradients,"In this paper, we developed a spheroid culture device that can trap a spheroid in the trapping site sandwiched by two extracellular matrix gels located at the upper and lower side of the spheroid. This device can form different biochemical gradients by applying target biochemicals separately in upper and lower channels, allowing us to study the angiogenic sprouting under various biochemical gradients in different directions. In the experiments, we confirmed the trapping of the spheroids and demonstrate the investigation on the direction and extent of angiogenic sprouts under unidirectional or bidirectional biochemical gradients. We believe our device can contribute to understanding the pathophysiological phenomena driven by chemical gradients, such as tissue development and tumor angiogenesis. "
Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes as Therapeutic Approach for Neurodegenerative Disorders: From Biology to Biotechnology,"The aging population has contributed to the rapid rise in the global incidence of neurodegenerative diseases. Despite the medical advances, there are no effective treatments for these disorders. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new treatments for these diseases. In this sense, cell therapy has been recognized as the best candidate for treating incurable diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders. However, the therapeutic use of these cells can be limited by several factors. Thus, there has been a rediscovery that extracellular vesicles, including exosomes, can be alternatively explored in the treatment of these diseases, overcoming the limits of cell-based therapy. In this sense, this review aims to revisit all areas from biology, including biogenesis and the content of exosomes, to biotechnology, proposing the minimal information required to isolate, characterize, and study the content of these vesicles for scientific and/or clinical purposes.

Hydrogen Peroxide-Preconditioned Human Adipose-Derived Stem Cells Enhance the Recovery of Oligodendrocyte-Like Cells after Oxidative Stress-Induced Damage,"Oxidative stress associated with neuroinflammation is a key process involved in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, and therefore, has been proposed as a crucial target for new therapies. Recently, the therapeutic potential of human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) has been investigated as a novel strategy for neuroprotection. These cells can be preconditioned by exposing them to mild stress in order to improve their response to oxidative stress. In this study, we evaluate the therapeutic potential of hASCs preconditioned with low doses of H2O2 (called HC016 cells) to overcome the deleterious effect of oxidative stress in an in vitro model of oligodendrocyte-like cells (HOGd), through two strategies: i, the culture of oxidized HOGd with HC016 cell-conditioned medium (CM), and ii, the indirect co-culture of oxidized HOGd with HC016 cells, which had or had not been exposed to oxidative stress. The results demonstrated that both strategies had reparative effects, oxidized HC016 cell co-culture being the one associated with the greatest recovery of the damaged HOGd, increasing their viability, reducing their intracellular reactive oxygen species levels and promoting their antioxidant capacity. Taken together, these findings support the view that HC016 cells, given their reparative capacity, might be considered an important breakthrough in cell-based therapies. "
"Does Active Design Influence Activity, Sitting, Wellbeing and Productivity in the Workplace? A Systematic Review","Active design is an emerging concept to incorporate physical activity into daily life through thoughtful design, and is often implemented in new building designs. It is, however, not known what evidence base there is to support the claims. Through this systematic review, the current evidence for active design was investigated. Seven databases were searched. A range of search terms relating to active design, physical activity, sitting, performance and wellbeing were used. After title and abstract screening of 1174 papers and full-text screening, 17 were selected for inclusion. The papers provided promising evidence of active design aiding a reduction in sitting and increase in standing time. Limited evidence was found for physical activity; a few studies reported an increase in step counts. Musculoskeletal effects were investigated in few studies, but there is some evidence of benefits to lower back pain. There was consistent evidence for better light and air quality, but no evidence for other features of the workplace environment. No conclusive evidence was found on associations between active design features and work performance. There is hence some evidence to support the benefit of active design on physical health; however, the dearth and heterogeneity of the study designs, measures and findings warrant further research. "
"MicroRNAs in Several Cutaneous Autoimmune Diseases: Psoriasis, Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus and Atopic Dermatitis","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate the gene expression at a post-transcriptional level and participate in maintaining the correct cell homeostasis and functioning. Different specific profiles have been identified in lesional skin from autoimmune cutaneous diseases, and their deregulation cause aberrant control of biological pathways, contributing to pathogenic conditions. Detailed knowledge of microRNA-affected pathways is of crucial importance for understating their role in skin autoimmune diseases. They may be promising therapeutic targets with novel clinical implications. They are not only present in skin tissue, but they have also been found in other biological fluids, such as serum, plasma and urine from patients, and therefore, they are potential biomarkers for the diagnosis, prognosis and response to treatment. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the role of described miRNAs in several cutaneous autoimmune diseases: psoriasis (Ps, 33 miRNAs), cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE, 2 miRNAs) and atopic dermatitis (AD, 8 miRNAs). We highlight their role as crucial elements implicated in disease pathogenesis and their applicability as biomarkers and as a novel therapeutic approach in the management of skin inflammatory diseases.

Is Sitting Always Inactive and Standing Always Active? A Simultaneous Free-Living activPal and ActiGraph Analysis,"Sedentary Behavior (SB), defined as sitting with minimal physical activity, is an emergent public health topic. However, the measurement of SB considers either posture (e.g., activPal) or physical activity (e.g., ActiGraph), and thus neglects either active sitting or inactive standing. The aim of this study was to determine the true amount of active sitting and inactive standing in daily life, and to analyze by how much these behaviors falsify the single sensors’ sedentary estimates. Sedentary time of 100 office workers estimated with activPal and ActiGraph was therefore compared with Bland-Altman statistics to a combined sensor analysis, the posture and physical activity index (POPAI). POPAI classified each activPal sitting and standing event into inactive or active using the ActiGraph counts. Participants spent 45.0% [32.2–59.1%] of the waking hours inactive sitting (equal to SB), 13.7% [7.8–21.6%] active sitting, and 12.0% [5.7–24.1%] inactive standing (mean [5th–95th percentile]). The activPal overestimated sedentary time by 30.3% [12.3–48.4%] and the ActiGraph by 22.5% [3.2–41.8%] (bias [95% limit-of-agreement]). The results showed that sitting is not always inactive, and standing is not always active. Caution should therefore be paid when interpreting the activPal (ignoring active sitting) and ActiGraph (ignoring inactive standing) measured time as SB. "
Relationship between Night Shifts and Risk of Breast Cancer among Nurses: A Systematic Review,"Background and objectives: The incidence of breast cancer worldwide has increased in recent decades, accounting for 1 in 3 neoplasms in women. Besides, nurses are mainly represented by the female collective, most of them, undertaking working conditions with intensive rotative and night shifts due to the 24-h pace of work of this profession. The objective of this study was to assess the possible relationship between shift work, especially night-time work, and the development of breast cancer among nurses. Materials and Methods: A systematic review of the literature was carried out through the consultation of the following databases: Cochrane Plus Library, PubMed, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Dialnet. Records were selected between 2010 and 2020, in Spanish and English, which covered the association between breast cancer diagnosed among nursing professionals and rotating night shifts. Results: A total of 12 studies were identified after critical reading. Most of the studies found an association between breast cancer and consecutive rotating night shifts prolonged over time. Among the associated factors, the alteration of the circadian rhythm influenced the expression of peripheral clock genes, which was the same as reproductive hormones. The risk of breast cancer in nurses increased during early adulthood and after 5 or more years with 6 or more consecutive nights. Conclusions: The different studies of this review show significant associations between breast cancer and prolonged rotating night shifts. Similarly, there is a relationship between the alterations in certain circadian rhythm markers (such as melatonin), epigenetic markers (such as telomeres), and breast cancer that would require more studies in order to corroborate these findings.

"Do Dominant Ants Affect Secondary Productivity, Behavior and Diversity in a Guild of Woodland Ants?","The degree to which competition by dominant species shapes ecological communities remains a largely unresolved debate. In ants, unimodal dominance–richness relationships are common and suggest that dominant species, when very abundant, competitively exclude non-dominant species. However, few studies have investigated the underlying mechanisms by which dominant ants might affect coexistence and the maintenance of species richness. In this study, we first examined the relationship between the richness of non-dominant ant species and the abundance of a dominant ant species, Formica subsericea, among forest ant assemblages in the eastern US. This relationship was hump-shaped or not significant depending on the inclusion or exclusion of an influential observation. Moreover, we found only limited evidence that F. subsericea negatively affects the productivity or behavior of non-dominant ant species. For example, at the colony-level, the size and productivity of colonies of non-dominant ant species were not different when they were in close proximity to dominant ant nests than when they were away and, in fact, was associated with increased productivity in one species. Additionally, the number of foraging workers of only one non-dominant ant species was lower at food sources near than far from dominant F. subsericea nests, while the number of foragers of other species was not negatively affected. However, foraging activity of the non-dominant ant species was greater at night when F. subsericea was inactive, suggesting a potential mechanism by which some non-dominant species avoid interactions with competitively superior species. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how patterns of community structure arise requires linking processes from colonies to communities. Our study suggests the negative effects of dominant ant species on non-dominant species may be offset by mechanisms promoting coexistence. "
Long-Term Effects of Organic Amendments on Soil Organic Matter Quantity and Quality in Conventional Cropping Systems in Switzerland,"Increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) in agroecosystems is a promising solution to simultaneously address climate change mitigation, adaptation, and food security. Yet, the best management practices that could achieve these goals remain to be identified. Here, we analyze the long-term effects of application of green manure, cereal straw, farmyard manure, and cattle slurry on SOC in a 37 year long field experiment in Switzerland. The treatment effects were compared against control conditions that received only optimal mineral fertilization. More specifically, this study aimed at evaluating the effect of organic amendments on SOC accumulation and distribution in different soil particle-size fractions by means of a set of indicators about organic matter quality (biological reactivity, humification index) and microbial activity (extracellular enzyme activities). In the absence of organic matter input, application of mineral fertilizers alone resulted in the lowest SOC content and the highest humification index of the bulk soil organic matter. Among the organic amendments, cereal straw, farmyard manure, and cattle slurry promoted a higher SOC content and a lower humification index due to an increase of SOC in the clay-size fraction. The annual C accrual reached 4.4‰ per year over 37 years with farmyard manure. The higher biological reactivity measured for the green manure and cereal straw amendments was associated with higher soil enzymatic activities, while C retention coefficients decreased by at least 2.5 times compared to animal-derived amendments. The low availability of nutrients in green manure and straw amendments as suggested by the high phosphatase and N-acetylglucosaminidase activities may indicate a reduction in C retention of organic matter inputs due to nutrient microbial mining with plant-derived amendments.

Not That Close to Mommy: Horizontal Transmission Seeds the Microbiome Associated with the Marine Sponge Plakina cyanorosea,"Marine sponges are excellent examples of invertebrate–microbe symbioses. In this holobiont, the partnership has elegantly evolved by either transmitting key microbial associates through the host germline and/or capturing microorganisms from the surrounding seawater. We report here on the prokaryotic microbiota during different developmental stages of Plakina cyanorosea and their surrounding environmental samples by a 16S rRNA metabarcoding approach. In comparison with their source adults, larvae housed slightly richer and more diverse microbial communities, which are structurally more related to the environmental microbiota. In addition to the thaumarchaeal Nitrosopumilus, parental sponges were broadly dominated by Alpha- and Gamma-proteobacteria, while the offspring were particularly enriched in the Vibrionales, Alteromonodales, Enterobacterales orders and the Clostridia and Bacteroidia classes. An enterobacterial operational taxonomic unit (OTU) was the dominant member of the strict core microbiota. The most abundant and unique OTUs were not significantly enriched amongst the microbiomes from host specimens included in the sponge microbiome project. In a wider context, Oscarella and Plakina are the sponge genera with higher divergence in their associated microbiota compared to their Homoscleromorpha counterparts. Our results indicate that P. cyanorosea is a low microbial abundance sponge (LMA), which appears to heavily depend on the horizontal transmission of its microbial partners that likely help the sponge host in the adaptation to its habitat.

"Structural Dependent Eu3+ Luminescence, Photoelectric and Hysteresis Effects in Porous Strontium Titanate","Eu3+ doped porous nanostructured SrTiO3 films and powder fabricated by sol-gel route without using any precursor template are characterized by different morphology and phase composition. The films show red and yellow luminescence with the most intensive photoluminescence (PL) bands at 612 nm and 588 nm, respectively. Raman, secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of undoped nanostructured porous SrTiO3 films showed the presence of TiO2, SrO, and SrTiO3 phases and their components. The undoped porous SrTiO3 films are photosensitive and demonstrate resistive switching. The capacitance-voltage hysteresis loops with the width of about 6 V in the frequency range of 2 kHz—2 MHz were observed. "
Research on the International Roughness Index Threshold of Road Rehabilitation in Metropolitan Areas: A Case Study in Taipei City,"The International Roughness Index (IRI) is the standard scale for evaluating road roughness in many countries in the world. The Taipei City government actively promotes a Road Smoothing Project and plans to complete the rehabilitation of the main and minor roads within its jurisdiction. This study aims to detect the road surface roughness in Taipei City and recommend appropriate IRI thresholds for road rehabilitation. A total of 171 asphalt concrete pavement sections in Taipei City with a total length of 803.49 km were analyzed and compared by IRI. The longitudinal profile of the detected road sections was measured using an inertial profiler. The statistical analysis showed that the IRI value prior to road leveling was mainly distributed between 5 and 8 m/km, while the IRI value after road leveling was mainly distributed between 3 and 4.5 m/km. This confirms that the implementation of the Road Smoothing Project has a significant effect on improving road smoothness. Moreover, based on the analysis results, it is recommended that the IRI threshold value for road rehabilitation in Taipei City be set at 4.50 m/km. "
Achieving Ambidexterity in Internationalization: Analysis of How SMEs Cope with Tensionsbetween Organizational Agility–Efficiency,"This study aims to examine how small and medium enterprises manage the tensions between organizational agility and efficiency. Organizational agility is a multidimensional concept where each of its components can interact differently with efficiency. The tensions between other capabilities have been explored in many previous studies, yet there is a lack of research exploring the roots of the tensions between organizational agility and efficiency, how the actors interpret these tensions and what dimensions of organizational agility are causing the tensions. A multiple case study research design with an inductive approach was used to explore how two SMEs manage the tensions between organizational agility and efficiency to serve customers from abroad. Despite the relationship between the agility and efficiency seeming contradictory, our analysis demonstrated that the interaction between the two concepts is complex, depending on the object of the tensions, the actors involved and the context. In fact, two actors at the same level of the organizational hierarchy can have identical perceptions about a tension, but they can arise from different logical reasoning. Moreover, due to the multidimensionality of organizational agility, a meta-capability of organizational agility is more likely to dominate the interaction with efficiency. This study contributes to the limited empirical evidence on how actors in SMEs perceive and manage the various tensions emerging from organizational agility and efficiency. "
Stepped-Wedge Cluster Randomised Trial of Social Prescribing of Forest Therapy for Quality of Life and Biopsychosocial Wellbeing in Community-Living Australian Adults with Mental Illness: Protocol,"Social Prescribing (SP) involves linking individuals with mental illness to local health and welfare services to improve quality of life (QoL) and biopsychosocial wellbeing. SP programs address psychosocial wellbeing by linking individuals to group activities. Forest Therapy (FT) is a group nature walk with prescribed activities that promote mindfulness, relaxation, and shared experience. Improvements in psychological and physical wellbeing have been demonstrated in FT, but psychosocial impacts have not been widely investigated. This study will implement an SP FT intervention and assess the impacts on QoL and biopsychosocial wellbeing. Participants will include 140 community-living adults with mental illness at Sydney/Gold Coast, Australia. A stepped-wedge cluster randomised design will be used; each participant will complete a 10-week control period followed by a 10-week FT intervention. Weekly 90-min FT sessions will be conducted in groups of 6–10 in local nature reserves. Validated tools will measure self-report QoL and biopsychosocial wellbeing pre- and post-control and intervention periods, and 5-week follow-up. Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured pre- and post-FT sessions. Hypothesised outcomes include improvements in QoL and biopsychosocial wellbeing. This study is the first to assess SP FT, and may provide evidence for a novel, scalable mental illness intervention. "
A Comprehensive Review of the Immunological Response against Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus Infection and Its Evasion Mechanisms,"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious viral disease, which has been reported for over 100 years, and against which the struggle has lasted for the same amount of time. It affects individuals from the order Artiodactyla, such as cattle, swine, sheep, wild animals from this order, and a few non-cloven hoofed species, such as mice and elephants. FMD causes large-scale economic losses for agricultural production systems; morbidity is almost 100% in an affected population, accompanied  by a high mortality rate in young animals due to myocarditis or an inability to suckle if a mother is ill. The aetiological agent is an Aphthovirus from the family Picornaviridae, having seven serotypes: A, O, C, SAT1, SAT2, SAT3, and Asia 1. Serotype variability means that an immune response is serospecific and vaccines are thus designed to protect against each serotype independently. A host’s adaptive immune response is key in defence against pathogens; however, this virus uses successful strategies (along with most microorganisms) enabling it to evade a host’s immune system to rapidly and efficiently establish itself within such host, and thus remain there. This review has been aimed at an in-depth analysis of the immune response in cattle and swine regarding FMD virus, the possible evasion mechanisms used by the virus and describing some immunological differences regarding these species. Such aspects can provide pertinent knowledge for developing new FMD control and prevention strategies. "
Advances and Trends in Pediatric Minimally Invasive Surgery,"As many meta-analyses comparing pediatric minimally invasive to open surgery can be found in the literature, the aim of this review is to summarize the current state of minimally invasive pediatric surgery and specifically focus on the trends and developments which we expect in the upcoming years. Print and electronic databases were systematically searched for specific keywords, and cross-link searches with references found in the literature were added. Full-text articles were obtained, and eligibility criteria were applied independently. Pediatric minimally invasive surgery is a wide field, ranging from minimally invasive fetal surgery over microlaparoscopy in newborns to robotic surgery in adolescents. New techniques and devices, like natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), single-incision and endoscopic surgery, as well as the artificial uterus as a backup for surgery in preterm fetuses, all contribute to the development of less invasive procedures for children. In spite of all promising technical developments which will definitely change the way pediatric surgeons will perform minimally invasive procedures in the upcoming years, one must bear in mind that only hard data of prospective randomized controlled and double-blind trials can validate whether these techniques and devices really improve the surgical outcome of our patients.

A Topic Modeling Analysis of TCGA Breast and Lung Cancer Transcriptomic Data ,"Topic modeling is a widely used technique to extract relevant information from large arrays of data. The problem of finding a topic structure in a dataset was recently recognized to be analogous to the community detection problem in network theory. Leveraging on this analogy, a new class of topic modeling strategies has been introduced to overcome some of the limitations of classical methods. This paper applies these recent ideas to TCGA transcriptomic data on breast and lung cancer. The established cancer subtype organization is well reconstructed in the inferred latent topic structure. Moreover, we identify specific topics that are enriched in genes known to play a role in the corresponding disease and are strongly related to the survival probability of patients. Finally, we show that a simple neural network classifier operating in the low dimensional topic space is able to predict with high accuracy the cancer subtype of a test expression sample.  "
Evaluation of Hybrid Melamine and Steel Fiber Reinforced Geopolymers Composites-6pt,"This study investigated the influence of the steel and melamine fibers hybridization on the flexural and compressive strength of a fly ash-based geopolymer. The applied reinforcement reduced the geopolymer brittleness. Currently, there are several types of polymer fibers available on the market. However, the authors did not come across information on the use of melamine fibers in geopolymer composites. Two systems of reinforcement for the composites were investigated in this work. Reinforcement with a single type of fiber and a hybrid system, i.e., two types of fibers. Both systems strengthened the base material. The research results showed the addition of melamine fibers as well as steel fibers increased the compressive and flexural strength in comparison to the plain matrix. In the case of a hybrid system, the achieved results showed a synergistic effect of the introduced fibers, which provided better strength results in relation to composites reinforced with a single type of fiber in the same amount by weight.

Media and Misinformation in Times of COVID-19: How People Informed Themselves in the Days Following the Portuguese Declaration of the State of Emergency,"This study takes as a starting point the importance and dependence of the media to obtain information about the pandemic. The dependency theory of the media system was developed in the 1970s when mass media were the dominant source of information. Today, at a time when media choices have become abundant, studies are needed to understand the phenomenon of media dependence in light of new dimensions made important by the transformations that have taken place in the social and media fields—where the coexistence of mass media with social media platforms stands out. As large-scale crises rarely occur and the media environment changes rapidly, it is important to analyze how media dependence relates to choose and trust in different media (traditional media vs. social media) in times of crisis. Several questions arise. What is the trust attributed by individuals to social media as sources of information about COVID-19? How well informed are the individuals who choose these sources as the main sources of information? From a questionnaire administered to 244 individuals in Portugal, during the first week of the state of emergency (March 2020), this research seeks to identify how people gained access to information about COVID-19, how they acted critically towards the various sources and how they assess the reliability of different media. Finally, it analyzes the association between the type of medium chosen and adherence to misinformation content about the virus. The results reveal the existence of a phenomenon of dependence on the media, with a strong exposure (both active and accidental) to informative content, with conventional media being privileged as the main source, and positively distinguished in terms of confidence. Finally, a statistically significant association of a positive sign was identified between the use of social media as the main source and the acceptance of misinformation. "
A New Decision-Making Approach Based on Fermatean Fuzzy Sets and WASPAS for Green Construction Supplier Evaluation,"The construction industry is an important industry because of its effects on different aspects of human life experiences and circumstances. Environmental concerns have been considered in designing and planning processes of construction supply chains in the recent past. One of the most crucial problems in managing supply chains is the process of evaluation and selection of green suppliers. This process can be categorized as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. The aim of this study is to propose a novel and efficient methodology for evaluation of green construction suppliers with uncertain information. The framework of the proposed methodology is based on weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) and the simple multi-attribute rating technique (SMART), and Fermatean fuzzy sets (FFSs) are used to deal with uncertainty of information. The methodology was applied to a green supplier evaluation and selection in the construction industry. Fifteen suppliers were chosen to be evaluated with respect to seven criteria including “estimated cost”, “delivery efficiency”, “product flexibility”, “reputation and management level”, “eco-design”, and “green image pollution”. Sensitivity and comparative analyses were also conducted to assess the efficiency and validity of the proposed methodology. The analyses showed that the results of the proposed methodology were stable and also congruent with those of some existing methods. "
"Fabrication of Activated Carbon Fibers with Sheath-Core, Hollow, or Porous Structures via Conjugated Melt Spinning of Polyethylene Precursor","Using polyethylene as carbon precursor, we have fabricated cost-effective carbon fibers with a sheath-core structure via conjugate melt spinning. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) were used as the sheath and core of the fiber, respectively, while sulfonation with sulfuric acid was conducted to enable the crosslinking of polyethylene. We demonstrated that carbonization and activation of the sheath-core-structured polyethylene fiber can result in a well-developed microporous structure in the sheath layer, and due to the core-sheath structure, the resulting activated carbon fibers exhibit a high tensile strength of ~455 MPa, initial modulus of ~14.4 GPa, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of ~1224 m2/g. Finally, activated carbon fibers with a hollow, sheath-core, and porous were successfully fabricated by controlling the degree of crosslinking of the LDPE/HDPE sheath-core fiber. "
Trends in Social Acceptance of Renewable Energy Across Europe—A Literature Review,"Social acceptance has proven to be a significant barrier in the implementation of renewable energy systems (hereinafter “RES”). While a general acceptance of RES is high, low local acceptance has hindered the development of renewable energy projects (hereinafter “REP”). This study assesses the determinants of local and general social acceptance of REP across Europe through a qualitative analysis from 25 case studies of the most significant social drivers and barriers that include all European countries. These case studies contain qualitative and quantitative analyses of the main factors for social acceptance of many representative groups including residents, stakeholders, and experts. Understanding the influences of social acceptance enables us to create strategies that will promote the development of REP by mitigating any public opposition. "
Synergistic Antimicrobial Activity of Supplemented Medical-Grade Honey against Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Formation and Eradication,"Biofilms hinder wound healing. Medical-grade honey (MGH) is a promising therapy because of its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and the lack of risk for resistance. This study investigated the inhibitory and eradicative activity against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms by different established MGH-based wound care formulations. Six different natural wound care products (Medihoney, Revamil, Mebo, Melladerm, L-Mesitran Ointment, and L-Mesitran Soft) were tested in vitro. Most of them contain MGH only, whereas some were supplemented. L-Mesitran Soft demonstrated the most potent antimicrobial activity (6.08-log inhibition and 3.18-log eradication). Other formulations ranged between 0.89-log and 4.80-log inhibition and 0.65-log and 1.66-log eradication. Therefore, the contribution of different ingredients of L-Mesitran Soft was investigated in more detail. The activity of the same batch of raw MGH (1.38-log inhibition and 2.35-log eradication), vitamins C and E (0.95-log inhibition and 0.94-log eradication), and all ingredients except MGH (1.69-log inhibition and 0.75-log eradication) clearly support a synergistic activity of components within the L-Mesitran Soft formulation. Several presented clinical cases illustrate its clinical antimicrobial efficacy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. In conclusion, MGH is a potent treatment for Pseudomonas biofilms. L-Mesitran Soft has the strongest antimicrobial activity, which is likely due to the synergistic activity mediated by its supplements. "
Glutamate Decarboxylase from Lactic Acid Bacteria—A Key Enzyme in GABA Synthesis,"Glutamate decarboxylase (l-glutamate-1-carboxylase, GAD; EC 4.1.1.15) is a pyridoxal-5’- phosphate-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the irreversible -decarboxylation of l-glutamic acid to -aminobutyric acid (GABA) and CO2. The enzyme is widely distributed in eukaryotes as well as prokaryotes, where it—together with its reaction product GABA—fulfils very different physiological functions. The occurrence of gad genes encoding GAD has been shown for many microorganisms, and GABA-producing lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been a focus of research during recent years. A wide range of traditional foods produced by fermentation based on LAB offer the potential of providing new functional food products enriched with GABA that may offer certain health-benefits. Different GAD enzymes and genes from several strains of LAB have been isolated and characterized recently. GABA-producing LAB, the biochemical properties of their GAD enzymes, and possible applications are reviewed here. "
Copper Concentrations in Ketamine Therapy for Treatment-Resistant Depression,"Changes in serum copper concentration are observed in patients with depressive symptoms. Unmet needs in contemporary antidepressant treatment have increased interest in non-monoaminergic antidepressants, such as ketamine, an anaesthetic drug that has demonstrated a rapid antidepressant effect in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The purpose of this study was to examine whether serum copper concentrations change during ketamine treatment and whether there is an association between the copper concentrations and treatment response measured using psychometric scale scores. Moreover, the interlink between somatic comorbidities and copper concentration was studied. Patients with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder were rated weekly by a clinician using the Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Copper level assessments were carried out weekly before the start of ketamine treatment and then after every second infusion and one week after the last ketamine infusion. The serum concentration of copper before ketamine treatment was significantly higher than that after the fifth infusion (p "
Toll-Like Receptor 7 Is Required for Lacrimal Gland Autoimmunity and Type 1 Diabetes Development in Male Nonobese Diabetic Mice,"Sjögren syndrome (SS) is an immunologically complex, chronic autoimmune disease targeting lacrimal and salivary glands. Nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice spontaneously develop inflammation of lacrimal and salivary glands with histopathological features similar to SS in humans including focal lymphocytic infiltrates in the affected glands. The innate immune signals driving lymphocytic infiltration of these glands are not well-defined. Here we evaluate the role of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 in the development of SS-like manifestations in NOD mice. We created a Tlr7 knockout NOD mouse strain and performed histological and gene expression studies to characterize the effects of TLR7 on autoimmunity development. TLR7 was required for male-specific lacrimal gland inflammation but not for female-specific salivary gland inflammation. Moreover, TLR7 was required for type 1 diabetes development in male but not female NOD mice. RNA sequencing demonstrated that TLR7 was associated with a type I interferon (IFN) response and a type I IFN-independent B cell response in the lacrimal glands. Together these studies identify a previously unappreciated pathogenic role for TLR7 in lacrimal gland autoimmunity and T1D development in male NOD mice adding to the growing body of evidence supporting sex differences in mechanisms of autoimmune disease in NOD mice.

Study of Combined Multi-Point Constraint Multi-Scale Modeling Strategy for Ultra-High-Performance Steel Fiber-Reinforced Concrete Structures,"Compared with normal strength concrete (NSC), ultra-high-performance steel fiber-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) shows superior performance. The concrete damage plasticity (CDP) model in ABAQUS can predict the mechanical properties of UHPFRC components well after calibration. However, the simulation of the whole structure is seriously restricted by the computational capability. In this study, a novel multi-scale modeling strategy for UHPFRC structure was proposed, which used a calibrated CDP model. A novel combined multi-point constraint (CMPC) was established by the simultaneous equations of displacement coordination and energy balance in different degrees of freedom of interface nodes. The advantage is to eliminate the problem of the tangential over-constraint of displacement coordination equation at the interface and to avoid stress iteration of the energy balance equation in the plastic stage. The expressions of CMPC equations of typical multi-scale interface connection were derived. The multi-scale models of UHPFRC components under several load cases were established. The results show that the proposed strategy can well predict the strain distribution and damage distribution of UHPFRC while significantly reducing the number of model elements and improving the computational efficiency. This study provides an accurate and efficient finite element modeling strategy for the design and analysis of UHPFRC structures. "

"Physiological, Biochemical, and Transcriptomic Responses of Neolamarckia cadamba to Aluminum Stress","Aluminum is the most abundant metal of the Earth’s crust accounting for 7% of its mass, and release of toxic Al3+ in acid soils restricts plant growth. Neolamarckia cadamba, a fast-growing tree, only grows in tropical regions with acidic soils. In this study, N. cadamba was treated with high concentrations of aluminum under acidic condition (pH 4.5) to study its physiological, biochemical, and molecular response mechanisms against high aluminum stress. High aluminum concentration resulted in significant inhibition of root growth with time in N. cadamba. The concentration of Al3+ ions in the root tip increased significantly and the distribution of absorbed Al3+ was observed in the root tip after Al stress. Meanwhile, the concentration of Ca, Mg, Mn, and Fe was significantly decreased, but P concentration increased. Aluminum stress increased activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase from micrococcus lysodeiktic (CAT), and peroxidase (POD) in the root tip, while the content of MDA was decreased. Transcriptome analysis showed 37,478 differential expression genes (DEGs) and 4096 GOs terms significantly associated with treatments. The expression of genes regulating aluminum transport and abscisic acid synthesis was significantly upregulated; however, the genes involved in auxin synthesis were downregulated. Of note, the transcripts of several key enzymes affecting lignin monomer synthesis in phenylalanine pathway were upregulated. Our results shed light on the physiological and molecular mechanisms of aluminum stress tolerance in N. cadamba. "
In-Situ Investigation on Nanoscopic Biomechanics of Streptococcus mutans at Low pH Citric Acid Environments Using an AFM Fluid Cell,"Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) is widely regarded as the main cause of human dental caries via three main virulence factors: adhesion, acidogenicity, and aciduricity. Citric acid is one of the antibiotic agents that can inhibit the virulence capabilities of S. mutans. A full understanding of the acidic resistance mechanisms (ARMs) causing bacteria to thrive in citrate transport is still elusive. We propose atomic force microscopy (AFM) equipped with a fluid cell to study the S. mutans ARMs via surface nanomechanical properties at citric acid pH 3.3, 2.3, and 1.8. Among these treatments, at pH 1.8, the effect of the citric acid shock in cells is demonstrated through a significantly low number of high adhesion zones, and a noticeable reduction in adhesion forces. Consequently, this study paves the way to understand that S. mutans ARMs are associated with the variation of the number of adhesion zones on the cell surface, which is influenced by citrate and proton transport. The results are expected to be useful in developing antibiotics or drugs involving citric acid for dental plaque treatment. "
Generic Digital Twin Architecture for Industrial Energy Systems,"Digital Twins have been in the focus of research in recent years, trying to achieve the vision of Industry 4.0. In the domain of industrial energy systems, they are applied to facilitate a flexible and optimized operation. With the help of Digital Twins, the industry can participate even stronger in the ongoing renewable energy transition. Current Digital Twin implementations are often application-specific solutions without general architectural concepts and their structures and namings differ, although the basic concepts are quite similar. For this reason, we analyzed concepts, architectures, and frameworks for Digital Twins in the literature to develop a technology-independent Generic Digital Twin Architecture (GDTA), which is aligned with the information technology layers of the Reference Architecture Model Industry 4.0 (RAMI4.0). This alignment facilitates a common naming and understanding of the proposed architectural structure. A proof-of-concept shows the application of Semantic Web technologies for instantiating the proposed GDTA for a use case of a Packed-Bed Thermal Energy Storage (PBTES). "
4D In-Situ Microscopy of Aerosol Filtration in a Wall Flow Filter,"The transient nature of the internal pore structure of particulate wall flow filters, caused by the continuous deposition of particulate matter, makes studying their flow and filtration characteristics challenging. In this article we present a new methodology and first experimental demonstration of time resolved in-situ synchrotron micro X-ray computed tomography (micro-CT) to study aerosol filtration. We directly imaged in 4D (3D plus time) pore scale deposits of TiO2 nanoparticles (nominal mean primary diameter of 25 nm) with a pixel resolution of 1.6 m. We obtained 3D tomograms at a rate of 1 per minute. The combined spatial and temporal resolution allows us to observe pore blocking and filling phenomena as they occur in the filter’s pore space. We quantified the reduction in filter porosity over time, from an initial porosity of 0.60 to a final porosity of 0.56 after 20 min. Furthermore, the penetration depth of particulate deposits and filtration rate was quantified. This novel image-based method offers valuable and statistically relevant insights into how the pore structure and function evolves during particulate filtration. Our data set will allow validation of simulations of automotive wall flow filters. Evolutions of this experimental design have potential for the study of a wide range of dry aerosol filters and could be directly applied to catalysed automotive wall flow filters. "
Ubiquitination and Ubiquitin-Like Modifications in Multiple Myeloma: Biology and Therapy,"Multiple myeloma is a genetically heterogeneous plasma cell malignancy characterized by organ damage and a massive production of (in-)complete monoclonal antibodies. Coping with protein homeostasis and post-translational regulation is therefore essential for multiple myeloma cells to survive. Furthermore, post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination and SUMOylation play key roles in essential pathways in multiple myeloma, including NFB signaling, epigenetic regulation, as well as DNA damage repair. Drugs modulating the ubiquitin–proteasome system, such as proteasome inhibitors and thalidomide analogs, are approved and highly effective drugs in multiple myeloma. In this review, we focus on ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modifications in the biology and current developments of new treatments for multiple myeloma. "
"Production, Characterization and Immunomodulatory Activity of an Extracellular Polysaccharide from Rhodotorula mucilaginosa YL-1 Isolated from Sea Salt Field","A novel exopolysaccharide from marine-derived red yeast Rhodotorula mucilaginosa strain YL-1 was produced and characterized. The highest yield of polysaccharide reached 15.1 g/L after medium and culture parameter optimization. This exopolysaccharide, composed of four neural monosaccharides including glucose, mannose, galactose and fucose, had an average molecular weight of 1200 KDa. It had good immunomodulatory activity on RAW256.7 cell lines. ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) and Q-PCR (quantitative real-time PCR) results showed that the cell was stimulated to express more IL-6, IL-18, IL-1 and TNF cytokines than the control group. This is the first report of an exopolysaccharide with immunomodulatory activity from marine-derived Rhodotorula mucilaginosa. "

Visible Light Communications for Industrial Applications—Challenges and Potentials," Visible Light Communication (VLC) is a short-range optical wireless communication technology that has been gaining attention due to its potential to offload heavy data traffic from the congested radio wireless spectrum. At the same time, wireless communications are becoming crucial to smart manufacturing within the scope of Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 is a developing trend of high-speed data exchange in automation for manufacturing technologies and is referred to as the fourth industrial revolution. This trend requires fast, reliable, low-latency, and cost-effective data transmissions with fast synchronizations to ensure smooth operations for various processes. VLC is capable of providing reliable, low-latency, and secure connections that do not penetrate walls and is immune to electromagnetic interference. As such, this paper aims to show the potential of VLC for industrial wireless applications by examining the latest research work in VLC systems. This work also highlights and classifies challenges that might arise with the applicability of VLC and visible light positioning (VLP) systems in these settings. Given the previous work performed in these areas, and the major ongoing experimental projects looking into the use of VLC systems for industrial applications, the use of VLC and VLP systems for industrial applications shows promising potential.

"Sulfates from the Pyrite Ore Deposits of the Apuan Alps (Tuscany, Italy): A Review","The occurrence of sulfate minerals associated with the pyrite ores of the southern Apuan Alps has been known since the 19th century but modern mineralogical studies started only in the last decade. Sulfate assemblages were identified in all the pyrite ore deposits from the studied area but the more impressive associations were discovered in the Fornovolasco and Monte Arsiccio mines. Their study allowed to improve the knowledge of the sulfate crystal-chemistry and to achieve a better understanding of the acid mine drainage (AMD) systems associated with pyrite oxidation. More than 20 different mineral species were identified and, among them, four sulfates (volaschioite, giacovazzoite, magnanelliite, and scordariite) have their type localities in the pyrite ore deposits of the Apuan Alps. A review of the mineralogical results of a ten-year-long study is given here. "
Generation and Evaluation of an African Swine Fever Virus Mutant with Deletion of the CD2v and UK Genes,"African swine fever (ASF) is a highly contagious and often lethal disease caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV). ASF emerged in China in August 2018 and has since rapidly spread into many areas of the country. The disease has caused a significant impact on China’s pig and related industries. A safe and effective vaccine is needed to prevent and control the disease. Several gene-deleted ASFVs have been reported; however, none of them is safe enough and commercially available. In this study, we report the generation of a double gene-deleted ASFV mutant, ASFV-SY18-CD2v/UK, from a highly virulent field strain ASFV-SY18 isolated in China. The results showed that ASFV-SY18-CD2v/UK lost hemadsorption properties, and the simultaneous deletion of the two genes did not significantly affect the in vitro replication of the virus in primary porcine alveolar macrophages. Furthermore, ASFV-SY18-CD2v/UK was attenuated in pigs. All the ASFV-SY18-CD2v/UK-inoculated pigs remained healthy, and none of them developed ASF-associated clinical signs. Additionally, the ASFV-SY18-CD2v/UK-infected pigs developed ASFV-specific antibodies, and no virus genome was detected in blood and nasal discharges at 21 and 28 days post-inoculation. More importantly, we found that all the pigs inoculated with 104 TCID50 of ASFV-SY18-CD2v/UK were protected against the challenge with the parental ASFV-SY18. However, low-level ASFV DNA was detected in blood, nasal swabs, and lymphoid tissue after the challenge. The results demonstrate that ASFV-SY18-CD2v/UK is safe and able to elicit protective immune response in pigs and can be a potential vaccine candidate to control ASF. "
Mumefural Improves Blood Flow in a Rat Model of FeCl3-Induced Arterial Thrombosis,"Mumefural (MF), a bioactive component of the processed fruit of Prunus mume Sieb. et Zucc, is known to inhibit platelet aggregation induced by agonists in vitro. In this study, we investigated the anti-thrombotic effects of MF using a rat model of FeCl3-induced arterial thrombosis. Sprague–Dawley rats were intraperitoneally injected with MF (0.1, 1, or 10 mg/kg) 30 min before 35% FeCl3 treatment to measure the time to occlusion using a laser Doppler flowmeter and to assess the weight of the blood vessels containing thrombus. MF treatment significantly improved blood flow by inhibiting occlusion and thrombus formation. MF also prevented collagen fiber damage in injured vessels and inhibited the expression of the platelet activation-related proteins P-selectin and E-selectin. Moreover, MF significantly reduced the increased inflammatory signal of nuclear factor (NF)-B, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, and interleukin (IL)-6 in blood vessels. After administration, MF was detected in the plasma samples of rats with a bioavailability of 36.95%. Therefore, we suggest that MF may improve blood flow as a candidate component in dietary supplements for improving blood flow and preventing blood circulation disorders. "
Porphyromonas gingivalis Mfa1 Induces Chemokine and Cell Adhesion Molecules in Mouse Gingival Fibroblasts via Toll-Like Receptors,"Porphyromonas gingivalis Mfa1 fimbriae are thought to act as adhesion factors and to direct periodontal tissue destruction but their immunomodulatory actions are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effect of Mfa1 stimulation on the immune and metabolic mechanisms of gingival fibroblasts from periodontal connective tissue. We also determined the role of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4 in Mfa1 recognition. Mfa1 increased the expression of genes encoding chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL) 1, CXCL3, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) 1 and Selectin endothelium (E) in gingival fibroblasts, but did not have a significant effect on genes that regulate metabolism. Mfa1-stimulated up-regulation of genes was significantly suppressed in Tlr4 siRNA-transfected cells compared with that in control siRNA-transfected cells, which indicates that recognition by TLR4 is essential for immunomodulation by Mfa1. Additionally, suppression of Tlr2 expression partially attenuated the stimulatory effect of Mfa1. Overall, these results help explain the involvement of P. gingivalis Mfa1 fimbriae in the progression of periodontal disease. "
"Role of the Main Non HLA-Specific Activating NK Receptors in Pancreatic, Colorectal and Gastric Tumors Surveillance","Human NK cells can control tumor growth and metastatic spread thanks to their powerful cytolytic activity which relies on the expression of an array of activating receptors. Natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) NKG2D and DNAM-1 are those non-HLA-specific activating NK receptors that are mainly involved in sensing tumor transformation by the recognition of different ligands, often stress-induced molecules, on the surface of cancer cells. Tumors display several mechanisms aimed at dampening/evading NK-mediated responses, a relevant fraction of which is based on the downregulation of the expression of activating receptors and/or their ligands. In this review, we summarize the role of the main non-HLA-specific activating NK receptors, NCRs, NKG2D and DNAM-1, in controlling tumor growth and metastatic spread in solid malignancies affecting the gastrointestinal tract with high incidence in the world population, i.e., pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and gastric cancer (GC), also describing the phenotypic and functional alterations induced on NK cells by their tumor microenvironment.

"Maize Yield Components as Affected by Plant Population, Planting Date and Soil Coverings in Brazil","The potential yield of annual crops is affected by management practices and water and energy availabilities throughout the crop season. The current work aimed to assess the effects of plant population, planting dates and soil covering on yield components of maize. Field experiments were carried out during the 2014–2015 and 2015–2016 growing seasons at areas grown with oat straw, voluntary plants and bare soil, considering five plant populations (40,000, 60,000, 80,000, 100,000 and 120,000 plants ha-1) and three sowing dates (15 September, 30 October and 15 December) for the hybrid P30F53YH in Ponta Grossa, State of Paraná, Brazil. Non-impacts of soil covering or plant population on plant height at the flowering phenological stage were observed. Significant effects of soil covering on yield components and final yield responses throughout the 2014–2015 season were detected. An influence of plant populations on yield components was evidenced, suggesting that, from 80,000 plants ha-1, the P30F53YH hybrid performs a compensatory effect among assessed yield components in such a way as to not compromise productivity insofar as the plant population increases up to 120,000 plants ha-1. It was noticed, a positive trend of yield components and crop final yield as a function of plant density increments. "
Bioassay-Guided Isolation of Anti-Alzheimer Active Components from the Aerial Parts of Hedyotis diffusa and Simultaneous Analysis for Marker Compounds,"Previous studies have reported that Hedyotis diffusa Willdenow extract shows various biological activities on cerebropathia, such as neuroprotection and short-term memory enhancement. However, there has been a lack of studies on the inhibitory activity on neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) through enzyme assays of H. diffusa. Therefore, H. diffusa extract and fractions were evaluated for their inhibitory effects through assays of enzymes related to AD, including acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and -site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and on the formation of advanced glycation end-product (AGE). In this study, ten bioactive compounds, including nine iridoid glycosides 1–9 and one flavonol glycoside 10, were isolated from the ethyl acetate and n-butanol fractions of H. diffusa using a bioassay-guided approach. Compound 10 was the strongest inhibitor of cholinesterase, BACE1, and the formation of AGEs of all isolated compounds, while compound 5 had the lowest inhibitory activity. Compounds 3, 6, and 9 exhibited better inhibitory activity than other compounds on AChE, and two pairs of diastereomeric iridoid glycoside structures (compounds 4, 8, and 6, 7) showed higher inhibitory activity than others on BChE. In the BACE1 inhibitory assay, compounds 1–3 were good inhibitors, and compound 10 showed higher inhibitory activity than quercetin, the positive control. Moreover, compounds 1 and 3 were stronger inhibitors of the formation of AGE than aminoguanidine (AMG), the positive control. In conclusion, this study is significant since it demonstrated that the potential inhibitory activity of H. diffusa on enzymes related to AD and showed the potential use for further study as a natural medicine for AD treatment on the basis of the bioactive components isolated from H. diffusa.

Isolation of a Lactobacillus paracasei Strain with Probiotic Attributes from Kefir Grains,"Kefir is a rich source of potentially probiotic bacteria. In the present study, firstly, in vitro screening for probiotic characteristics of ten lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from kefir grains was performed. Strain AGR 4 was selected for further studies. Molecular characterization of strain AGR 4, confirmed that AGR 4 belongs to the Lactobacillus paracasei (reclassified to Lacticaseibacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei) species. Further testing revealed that L. paracasei AGR 4 displayed adhesion capacity on human adenocarcinoma cells, HT-29, similar to that of the reference strain, L. casei ATCC 393. In addition, the novel strain exerted significant time- and dose-dependent antiproliferative activity against HT-29 cells and human melanoma cell line, A375, as demonstrated by the sulforhodamine B cytotoxicity assay. Flow cytometry analysis was employed to investigate the mechanism of cellular death; however, it was found that AGR 4 did not act by inducing cell cycle arrest and/or apoptotic cell death. Taken together, these findings promote the probiotic character of the newly isolated strain L. paracasei AGR 4, while further studies are needed for the detailed description of its biological properties.

Lagrangian Formulation of Free Arbitrary N-Extended Massless Higher Spin Supermultiplets in 4D AdS Space,"We derived the component Lagrangian for the free N-extended on-shell massless higher spin supermultiplets in four-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. The construction was based on the frame-like description of massless integer and half-integer higher spin fields. The massless supermultiplets were formulated for N4k, where k is a maximal integer or half-integer spin in the multiplet. The supertransformations that leave the Lagrangian invariant were found in explicit form and it was shown that their algebra is closed on-shell. "

Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling of Metoprolol Enantiomers and -Hydroxymetoprolol to Describe CYP2D6 Drug-Gene Interactions,"The beta-blocker metoprolol (the sixth most commonly prescribed drug in the USA in 2017) is subject to considerable drug–gene interaction (DGI) effects caused by genetic variations of the CYP2D6 gene. CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (5.7% of US population) show approximately five-fold higher metoprolol exposure compared to CYP2D6 normal metabolizers. This study aimed to develop a whole-body physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to predict CYP2D6 DGIs with metoprolol. The metoprolol (R)- and (S)-enantiomers as well as the active metabolite -hydroxymetoprolol were implemented as model compounds, employing data of 48 different clinical studies (dosing range 5–200 mg). To mechanistically describe the effect of CYP2D6 polymorphisms, two separate metabolic CYP2D6 pathways (-hydroxylation and O-demethylation) were incorporated for both metoprolol enantiomers. The good model performance is demonstrated in predicted plasma concentration–time profiles compared to observed data, goodness-of-fit plots, and low geometric mean fold errors of the predicted AUClast (1.27) and Cmax values (1.23) over all studies. For DGI predictions, 18 out of 18 DGI AUClast ratios and 18 out of 18 DGI Cmax ratios were within two-fold of the observed ratios. The newly developed and carefully validated model was applied to calculate dose recommendations for CYP2D6 polymorphic patients and will be freely available in the Open Systems Pharmacology repository.

Promotion of Disposable Electronic Cigarette Flavors and Topics on Twitter,"Disposable electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) became popular among youth after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) implemented an enforcement policy to restrict the sale of cartridge-based flavored e-cigarettes starting from February 2020 in the United States (US). We aimed to examine the flavors and topics related to disposable e-cigarettes on Twitter. The Twitter dataset, which includes 1489 tweets, was collected by the Tweepy streamapplication programming interface (API) using a keyword query from March to September 2020. The disposable e-cigarette flavors were curated from both online stores and collected tweets. Topics related to disposable e-cigarettes on Twitter were manually coded. Distributions of topics were compared between tweets from the US and tweets from non-US countries. The temporal analysis results showed a slight increase in the number of discussions over the study period. Strawberry, mango, watermelon, and mint were the most popular flavors of disposable e-cigarettes mentioned on Twitter. Almost all the tweets (97.11%) were commercial tweets, which were dominated by topics related to the product and flavor promotions. The US tweets focused more on product and flavor promotions and less on price promotions compared to non-US tweets. Our results suggest that companies exploited the limitations of legislation to promote flavors on Twitter, which could undermine public health and young people’s finances if they get hooked on addictive products.

The Failed Clinical Story of Myostatin Inhibitors against Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: Exploring the Biology behind the Battle,"Myostatin inhibition therapy has held much promise for the treatment of muscle wasting disorders. This is particularly true for the fatal myopathy, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Following on from promising pre-clinical data in dystrophin-deficient mice and dogs, several clinical trials were initiated in DMD patients using different modality myostatin inhibition therapies. All failed to show modification of disease course as dictated by the primary and secondary outcome measures selected: the myostatin inhibition story, thus far, is a failed clinical story. These trials have recently been extensively reviewed and reasons why pre-clinical data collected in animal models have failed to translate into clinical benefit to patients have been purported. However, the biological mechanisms underlying translational failure need to be examined to ensure future myostatin inhibitor development endeavors do not meet with the same fate. Here, we explore the biology which could explain the failed translation of myostatin inhibitors in the treatment of DMD. "
Neural-Network-Based Curve Fitting Using Totally Positive Rational Bases,"This paper proposes a method for learning the process of curve fitting through a general class of totally positive rational bases. The approximation is achieved by finding suitable weights and control points to fit the given set of data points using a neural network and a training algorithm, called AdaMax algorithm, which is a first-order gradient-based stochastic optimization. The neural network presented in this paper is novel and based on a recent generalization of rational curves which inherit geometric properties and algorithms of the traditional rational Bézier curves. The neural network has been applied to different kinds of datasets and  it has been compared with the traditional least-squares method to test its performance. The obtained results show that our method can generate a satisfactory approximation. "
Post-Vaccination Yellow Fever Antiserum Reduces Zika Virus in Embryoid Bodies When Placental Cells are Present,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that originated in Africa but emerged in Latin America in 2015. In this region, other flaviviruses such as Dengue (DENV), West Nile, and Yellow Fever virus (YFV) also circulate, allowing for possible antigenic cross-reactivity to impact viral infections and immune responses. Studies have found antibody-mediated enhancement between DENV and ZIKV, but the impact of YFV antibodies on ZIKV infection has not been fully explored. ZIKV infections cause congenital syndromes, such as microcephaly, necessitating further research into ZIKV vertical transmission through the placental barrier. Recent advancements in biomedical engineering have generated co-culture methods that allow for the in vitro recapitulation of the maternal–fetal interface. This study utilized a transwell assay, which was a co-culture model utilizing human placental syncytiotrophoblasts, fetal umbilical cells, and a differentiating embryoid body, to replicate the maternal–fetal axis. To determine if cross-reactive YFV vaccine antibodies impacted the pathogenesis of ZIKV across the maternal–fetal axis, syncytiotrophoblasts were inoculated with ZIKV or ZIKV incubated with YFV vaccine antisera, and the viral load was measured 72 h post-inoculation. Here, we report that BeWo and HUVEC cells were permissive to ZIKV and that the impact of YFV post-vaccination antibodies on ZIKV replication was cell line-dependent. Embryoid bodies were also permissive to ZIKV, and the presence of YFV antibodies collected 4–14 months post-vaccination reduced ZIKV infection when placental cells were present. However, when directly infected with ZIKV, the embryoid bodies displayed significantly increased viral loads in the presence of YFV antiserum taken 30 days post-vaccination. The data show that each of the cell lines and EBs have a unique response to ZIKV complexed with post-vaccination serum, suggesting there may be cell-specific mechanisms that impact congenital ZIKV infections. Since ZIKV infections can cause severe congenital syndromes, it is crucial to understand any potential enhancement or protection offered from cross-reactive, post-vaccination antibodies. "
Explicit Time-Domain Approach for Random Vibration Analysis of Jacket Platforms Subjected to Wave Loads,"This paper is devoted to the random vibration analysis of jacket platforms under wave loads using the explicit time-domain approach. The Morison equation is first used to obtain the nonlinear random wave loads, which are discretized into random loading vectors at a series of time instants. The Newmark- integration scheme is then employed to construct the explicit expressions for dynamic responses of jacket platforms in terms of the random vectors at different time instants. On this basis, Monte Carlo simulation can further be conducted at high efficiency, which not only provides the statistical moments of the random responses, but also gives the mean peak values of responses. Compared with the traditional power spectrum method, nonlinear wave loads can be readily taken into consideration in the present approach rather than using the equivalent linearized Morison equation. Compared with the traditional Monte Carlo simulation, the response statistics can be obtained through the direct use of the explicit expressions of dynamic responses rather than repeatedly solving the equation of motion. An engineering example is analyzed to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the present approach. "
Features Associated With Depressive Predominant Polarity and Early Illness Onset in Patients With Bipolar Disorder,"Objective: The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of three possible diagnostic specifiers, namely predominant polarity (PP) throughout illness, polarity of the first episode and early age at onset, in a sample of bipolar disorder (BD) patients and their association with important socio-demographic, clinical and course-of-illness variables.

Immunotherapy Advances for Epithelial Ovarian Cancer,"New treatment modalities are needed in order to improve the prognosis of women diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), the most aggressive gynecologic cancer type. Most ovarian tumors are infiltrated by immune effector cells, providing the rationale for targeted approaches that boost the existing or trigger new anti-tumor immune mechanisms. The field of immuno-oncology has experienced remarkable progress in recent years, although the results seen with single agent immunotherapies in several categories of solid tumors have yet to extend to ovarian cancer. The challenge remains to determine what treatment combinations are most suitable for this disease and which patients are likely to benefit and to identify how immunotherapy should be incorporated into EOC standard of care. We review here some of the most promising immune therapies for EOC and focus on those currently tested in clinical trials. "

Lipid-Iron Nanoparticle with a Cell Stress Release Mechanism Combined with a Local Alternating Magnetic Field Enables Site-Activated Drug Release,"Most available cancer chemotherapies are based on systemically administered small organic molecules, and only a tiny fraction of the drug reaches the disease site. The approach causes significant side effects and limits the outcome of the therapy. Targeted drug delivery provides an alternative to improve the situation. However, due to the poor release characteristics of the delivery systems, limitations remain. This report presents a new approach to address the challenges using two fundamentally different mechanisms to trigger the release from the liposomal carrier. We use an endogenous disease marker, an enzyme, combined with an externally applied magnetic field, to open the delivery system at the correct time only in the disease site. This site-activated release system is a novel two-switch nanomachine that can be regulated by a cell stress-induced enzyme at the cellular level and be remotely controlled using an applied magnetic field. We tested the concept using sphingomyelin-containing liposomes encapsulated with indocyanine green, fluorescent marker, or the anticancer drug cisplatin. We engineered the liposomes by adding paramagnetic beads to act as a receiver of outside magnetic energy. The developed multifunctional liposomes were characterized in vitro in leakage studies and cell internalization studies. The release system was further studied in vivo in imaging and therapy trials using a squamous cell carcinoma tumor in the mouse as a disease model. In vitro studies showed an increased release of loaded material when stress-related enzyme and magnetic field was applied to the carrier liposomes. The theranostic liposomes were found in tumors, and the improved therapeutic effect was shown in the survival studies. "
Diversity and Distribution of the Dominant Ant Genus Anonychomyrma (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in the Australian Wet Tropics,"Anonychomyrma is a dolichoderine ant genus of cool-temperate Gondwanan origin with a current distribution that extends from the north of southern Australia into the Australasian tropics. Despite its abundance and ecological dominance, little is known of its species diversity and distribution throughout its range. Here, we describe the diversity and distribution of Anonychomyrma in the Australian Wet Tropics bioregion, where only two of the many putative species are described. We hypothesise that the genus in tropical Australia retains a preference for cool wet rainforests reminiscent of the Gondwanan forests that once dominated Australia, but now only exist in upland habitats of the Wet Tropics. Our study was based on extensive recent surveys across five subregions and along elevation and vertical (arboreal) gradients. We integrated genetic (CO1) data with morphology to recognise 22 species among our samples, 20 of which appeared to be undescribed. As predicted, diversity and endemism were concentrated in uplands above 900 m a.s.l. Distribution modelling of the nine commonest species identified maximum temperature of the warmest month, rainfall seasonality, and rainfall of the wettest month as correlates of distributional patterns across subregions. Our study supported the notion that Anonychomyrma radiated from a southern temperate origin into the tropical zone, with a preference for areas of montane rainforest that were stably cool and wet over the late quaternary.

"Programmable Stimuli-Responsive Actuators for Complex Motions in Soft Robotics: Concept, Design and Challenges","During the last years, great progress was made in material science in terms of concept, design and fabrication of new composite materials with conferred properties and desired functionalities. The scientific community paid particular interest to active soft materials, such as soft actuators, for their potential as transducers responding to various stimuli aiming to produce mechanical work. Inspired by this, materials engineers today are developing multidisciplinary approaches to produce new active matters, focusing on the kinematics allowed by the material itself more than on the possibilities offered by its design. Traditionally, more complex motions beyond pure elongation and bending are addressed by the robotics community. The present review targets encompassing and rationalizing a framework which will help a wider scientific audience to understand, sort and design future soft actuators and methods enabling complex motions. Special attention is devoted to recent progress in developing innovative stimulus-responsive materials and approaches for complex motion programming for soft robotics. In this context, a challenging overview of the new materials as well as their classification and comparison (performances and characteristics) are proposed. In addition, the great potential of soft transducers are outlined in terms of kinematic capabilities, illustrated by the related application. Guidelines are provided to design actuators and to integrate asymmetry enabling motions along any of the six basic degrees of freedom (translations and rotations), and strategies towards the programming of more complex motions are discussed. As a final note, a series of manufacturing methods are described and compared, from molding to 3D and 4D printing. The review ends with a Perspectives section, from material science and microrobotic points of view, on the soft materials' future and close future challenges to be overcome. "
Towards the Agenda 2030: A Quantitative Analysis of Synergies and Trade-Offs between the SDGs of Spain during 2000–2019,"Global sustainable development has been marked by the United Nations plans for more than two decades. These plans were adopted by most of the developed and developing countries to achieve the Agenda 2030, currently formed by the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Analysis of the interactions between the SDGs has been a growing area in research and of interest for governments. However, studies on how deteriorated goals can be accelerated by positive interactions with other goals are lacking for specific countries at present. This study aims at filling this gap by finding and quantifying the synergies and trade-offs between the SDGs for Spain. During the years 2000–2019, almost 80% of the SDG targets had significant interactions, either positive (synergy) or negative (trade-off). SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 5 (gender Equality) and SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) contained the larger number of positive interactions, more than 60% in all of them. SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing) was strongly linked with indicators from SDG 4 (quality education) and also SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation). Furthermore, indicators from SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) shared a high correlation with the ones from SGD 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 15 (life on land). SDG 1 (no poverty), 2 (zero hunger), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 8 (decent work and economic growth) and 11 (sustainable cities and communities) had the slowest evolution during the years 2000–2019, showing contractions in some instances. We developed a regression model to assess the influence that selected targets have had on a less evolved target (target 8.6—proportion of youth not in education, employment or training). We managed to clarify high influence from target 1.3 (unemployment compensations), target 8.4 (domestic material consumption) and target 10.5 (non-performing loans) on the dependent variable. Identifying numerical dependencies between the SDGs may help nations to develop a roadmap where targets work as cogwheel towards achieving the Agenda 2030. "

Novel Psychoactive Phenethylamines: Impact on Genetic Material,"Psychedelic and stimulating phenethylamines belong to the family of new psychoactive substances (NPS). The acute toxicity framework has begun to be investigated, while studies showing genotoxic potential are very limited or not available. Therefore, in order to fill this gap, the aim of the present work was to evaluate the genotoxicity by treating TK6 cells with 2C-H, 2C-I, 2C-B, 25B-NBOMe, and the popular 3,4-Methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA). On the basis of cytotoxicity and cytostasis results, we selected the concentrations (6.25–35 M) to be used in genotoxicity analysis. We used the micronucleus (MN) as indicator of genetic damage and analyzed the MNi frequency fold increase by an automated flow cytometric protocol. All substances, except MDMA, resulted genotoxic; therefore, we evaluated reactive oxygen species (ROS) induction as a possible mechanism at the basis of the demonstrated genotoxicity. The obtained results showed a statistically significant increase in ROS levels for all genotoxic phenethylamines confirming this hypothesis. Our results highlight the importance of genotoxicity evaluation for a complete assessment of the risk associated also with NPS exposure. Indeed, the subjects who do not have hazardous behaviors or require hospitalization by using active but still “safe” doses could run into genotoxicity and in the well-known long-term effects associated.

Age-Related Decline of Sensorimotor Integration Influences Resting-State Functional Brain Connectivity,"Age-related decline in sensorimotor integration involves both peripheral and central components related to proprioception and kinesthesia. To explore the role of cortical motor networks, we investigated the association between resting-state functional connectivity and a gap-detection angle measured during an arm-reaching task. Four region pairs, namely the left primary sensory area with the left primary motor area (S1left–M1left), the left supplementary motor area with M1left (SMAleft–M1left), the left pre-supplementary motor area with SMAleft (preSMAleft–SMAleft), and the right pre-supplementary motor area with the right premotor area (preSMAright–PMdright), showed significant age-by-gap detection ability interactions in connectivity in the form of opposite-sign correlations with gap detection ability between younger and older participants. Morphometry and tractography analyses did not reveal corresponding structural effects. These results suggest that the impact of aging on sensorimotor integration at the cortical level may be tracked by resting-state brain activity and is primarily functional, rather than structural. From the observation of opposite-sign correlations, we hypothesize that in aging, a “low-level” motor system may hyper-engage unsuccessfully, its dysfunction possibly being compensated by a “high-level” motor system, wherein stronger connectivity predicts higher gap-detection performance. This hypothesis should be tested in future neuroimaging and clinical studies. "
Precision Medicine for the Management of Therapy Refractory Colorectal Cancer,"In this analysis, we examined the efficacy, feasibility, and limitations of molecular-based targeted therapies in heavily pretreated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients after failure of all standard treatments. In this single-center, real-world retrospective analysis of our platform for precision medicine, we mapped the molecular profiles of 60 mCRC patients. Tumor samples of the patients were analyzed using next-generation sequencing panels of mutation hotspots, microsatellite instability testing, and immunohistochemistry. All profiles were reviewed by a multidisciplinary team to provide a targeted treatment recommendation after consensus discussion. In total, we detected 166 mutations in 53 patients. The five most frequently found mutations were TP53, KRAS, APC, PIK3CA, and PTEN. In 28 cases (47% of all patients), a molecularly targeted therapy could be recommended. Eventually, 12 patients (20%) received the recommended therapy. Six patients (10%) had a clinical benefit. The median time to treatment failure was 3.1 months. Our study demonstrates the feasibility and applicability of using targeted therapies in daily clinical practice for heavily pretreated mCRC patients. This could be used as a targeted treatment option in half of the patients. "
Engineering Properties of Waste Sawdust-Based Lightweight Alkali-Activated Concrete: Experimental Assessment and Numerical Prediction,"Alkali activated concretes have emerged as a prospective alternative to conventional concrete wherein diverse waste materials have been converted as valuable spin-offs. This paper presents a wide experimental study on the sustainability of employing waste sawdust as a fine/coarse aggregate replacement incorporating fly ash (FA) and granulated blast furnace slag (GBFS) to make high-performance cement-free lightweight concretes. Waste sawdust was replaced with aggregate at 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 vol% incorporating alkali binder, including 70% FA and 30% GBFS. The blend was activated using a low sodium hydroxide concentration (2 M). The acoustic, thermal, and predicted engineering properties of concretes were evaluated, and the life cycle of various mixtures were calculated to investigate the sustainability of concrete. Besides this, by using the available experimental test database, an optimized Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was developed to estimate the mechanical properties of the designed alkali-activated mortar mixes depending on each sawdust volume percentage. Based on the findings, it was found that the sound absorption and reduction in thermal conductivity were enhanced with increasing sawdust contents. The compressive strengths of the specimens were found to be influenced by the sawdust content and the strength dropped from 65 to 48 MPa with the corresponding increase in the sawdust levels from 0% up to 100%. The results also showed that the emissions of carbon dioxide, energy utilization, and outlay tended to drop with an increase in the amount of sawdust and show more the lightweight concrete to be more sustainable for construction applications.

Performance of High Rap Half-Warm Mix Asphalt,"The current global situation regarding climate change makes it necessary to promote the circular economy and the use of more environmentally friendly technologies in the construction sector. To that end, it is of interest to deepen our understanding of the performance of half-warm mix asphalt (HWMA) manufactured with high proportions of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP). Thus, in the present study, a laboratory analysis was carried out in which the behavior of HWMA manufactured with 100% RAP and without rejuvenators was compared with that of a control mix, i.e., an HWMA manufactured with 0% RAP. In particular, we analyzed the compaction energy with a gyratory compactor, mixing time and temperature, volumetric properties, moisture damage resistance through indirect tensile tests after immersion (ITS), stiffness based on the resilient modulus, resistance to permanent deformation using wheel tracking tests, and fatigue resistance through indirect tensile fatigue tests (ITFT). Both mixtures displayed adequate volumetric and mechanical properties, but the performance of the high-RAP HWMA was better than that of the control mixture in terms of resistance to permanent deformation in hot areas. In addition, the high-RAP HWMA without rejuvenators could provide energy and material savings, thus promoting sustainable development. "
Long-Term Determinants of the Seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii in a Wild Ungulate Community,"Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan which infects warm-blooded vertebrates, including humans, worldwide. In the present study, the epidemiology of T. gondii was studied in the wild ungulate host community (wild boar, red deer, and fallow deer) of Doñana National Park (DNP, south-western Spain) for 13 years (2005–2018). We assessed several variables which potentially operate in the medium and long-term (environmental features, population, and stochastic factors). Overall, the wild ungulate host community of DNP had high seroprevalence values of T. gondii (STG; %  confidence interval (CI) 95%; wild boar (Sus scrofa) 39  3.3, n "
"Breast Cancer Stem Cells: Biomarkers, Identification and Isolation Methods, Regulating Mechanisms, Cellular Origin, and Beyond","Despite recent advances in diagnosis and treatment, breast cancer (BC) is still a major cause of cancer-related mortality in women. Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are a small but significant subpopulation of heterogeneous breast cancer cells demonstrating strong self-renewal and proliferation properties. Accumulating evidence has proved that BCSCs are the driving force behind BC tumor initiation, progression, metastasis, drug resistance, and recurrence. As a heterogeneous disease, BC contains a full spectrum of different BC subtypes, and different subtypes of BC further exhibit distinct subtypes and proportions of BCSCs, which correspond to different treatment responses and disease-specific outcomes. This review summarized the current knowledge of BCSC biomarkers and their clinical relevance, the methods for the identification and isolation of BCSCs, and the mechanisms regulating BCSCs. We also discussed the cellular origin of BCSCs and the current advances in single-cell lineage tracing and transcriptomics and their potential in identifying the origin and lineage development of BCSCs.

Development and Validation of High-Throughput Bioanalytical Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) Method for the Quantification of Newly Synthesized Antitumor Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors in Human Plasma,"In the present study, a sensitive and fully validated bioanalytical high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method has been developed for the quantitative determination of three newly synthesized carbonic anhydrases inhibitors (CAIs) with potential antitumor activity in human plasma. The analytes and the internal standard (IS) were extracted using 1.5 mL acetonitrile from only 450 L aliquots of human plasma to achieve the desired protein precipitation. Chromatographic separations were achieved on Phenomenex Kinetex® C18 column (100  4.6 mm, 2.6 m) using a binary gradient elution mode with a run time of less than 6 min. The mobile phase consisted of solvent (A): 0.1% formic acid in 50% methanol and solvent B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (30:70, v/v), pumped at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. Detection was employed using triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer (API 3500) equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source in the positive ion mode. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode was selected for quantitation through monitoring the precursor-to-parent ion transition at m/z 291.9  173.0, m/z 396.9  225.1, m/z 388.9  217.0, and m/z 146.9  91.0 for AW-9a, WES-1, WES-2, and Coumarin (IS), respectively. Linearity was computed using the weighted least-squares linear regression method (1/x2) over a concentration range of 1–1000, 2.5–800, and 5–500 ng/mL for AW-9a, WES-1, and WES-2; respectively. The bioanalytical LC-MS/MS method was fully validated as per U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines with all respect to linearity, accuracy, precision, carry-over, selectivity, dilution integrity, and stability. The proposed LC-MS/MS method was applied successfully for the determination of all investigated drugs in spiked human plasma with no significant matrix effect, which is a crucial cornerstone in further therapeutic drug monitoring of newly developed therapeutic agents.

"No Easy Way Out for EZH2: Its Pleiotropic, Noncanonical Effects on Gene Regulation and Cellular Function","Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) plays critical roles in a range of biological processes including organ development and homeostasis, epigenomic and transcriptomic regulation, gene repression and imprinting, and DNA damage repair. A widely known function of EZH2 is to serve as an enzymatic subunit of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and catalyze trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) for repressing target gene expression. However, an increasing body of evidence demonstrates that EZH2 has many “non-conventional” functions that go beyond H3K27 methylation as a Polycomb factor. First, EZH2 can methylate a number of nonhistone proteins, thereby regulating cellular processes in an H3K27me3-independent fashion. Furthermore, EZH2 relies on both methyltransferase-dependent and methyltransferase-independent mechanisms for modulating gene-expression programs and/or epigenomic patterns of cells. Importantly, independent of PRC2, EZH2 also forms physical interactions with a number of DNA-binding factors and transcriptional coactivators to context-dependently influence gene expression. The purpose of this review is to detail the complex, noncanonical roles of EZH2, which are generally less appreciated in gene and (epi)genome regulation. Because EZH2 deregulation is prevalent in human diseases such as cancer, there is increased dependency on its noncanonical function, which shall have important implications in developing more effective therapeutics. "
Impact of the Tumor Microenvironment on Tumor Heterogeneity and Consequences for Cancer Cell Plasticity and Stemness,"Tumor heterogeneity is considered the major cause of treatment failure in current cancer therapies. This feature of solid tumors is not only the result of clonal outgrowth of cells with genetic mutations, but also of epigenetic alterations induced by physical and chemical signals from the tumor microenvironment (TME). Besides fibroblasts, endothelial and immune cells, mesenchymal stroma/stem-like cells (MSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) intimately crosstalk with cancer cells and can exhibit both anti- and pro-tumorigenic effects. MSCs can alter cancer cellular phenotypes to increase cancer cell plasticity, eventually resulting in the generation of cancer stem cells (CSCs). The shift between different phenotypic states (phenotype switching) of CSCs is controlled via both genetic programs, such as epithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation or retrodifferentiation, and epigenetic alterations triggered by signals from the TME, like hypoxia, spatial heterogeneity or stromal cell-derived chemokines. Finally, we highlight the role of spontaneous cancer cell fusion with various types of stromal cells. i.e., MSCs in shaping CSC plasticity. A better understanding of cell plasticity and phenotype shifting in CSCs is a prerequisite for exploiting this phenomenon to reduce tumor heterogeneity, thereby improving the chance for therapy success.

The Association between the Usage of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs and Cognitive Status: Analysis of Longitudinal and Cross-Sectional Studies from the Global Alzheimer’s Association Interactive Network and Transcriptomic Data,"The degenerative cognitive and physical decline of Alzheimer patients, coupled with the extensive psychological and economic tolls imposed on family members that serve as caretakers, necessitate the discovery of effective cures and preventative measures for age-related cognitive depreciation. In the journey of Alzheimer’s disease treatment discovery, several cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have delineated a noticeable association between the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), a class of low-cost drugs with minimal side effects, and the alleviation of age-related memory impairment. In this study, four datasets (two cross-sectional and two longitudinal studies) derived from the Global Alzheimer’s Association Interactive Network (GAAIN) were analyzed. The significant association between the usage of NSAIDs and better cognitive status was observed. The results agree with the findings of previous studies that the use of NSAIDs may be beneficial in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease. Transcriptomic data show that ibuprofen treatment results in upregulation of several genes involved in arachidonic acid metabolism including PPAR, Cyp4a12b, Cyp2c66, and Cyp2c37 in the hippocampus. The increase in conversion of arachidonic acid into anti-inflammatory 16C and 18C dicarboxylic acids as well as epoxyeicosatrienoic acids may play a role in reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s disease development.

Design of an Enhanced FLC-Based Controller for Selective Harmonic Compensation in Active Power Filters,"The increasing number of electronic loads has introduced several harmonics into the power system, leading to a growth in the importance of filters intended for their mitigation. Thus, it is important to have the knowledge to select operational limits of each new filter connected in the power grid. Likewise, obtaining these harmonics requires robust tracking systems that provide enough information for better filter selectivity. This paper proposes a selective harmonic active filter control based on Fourier linear combiner (FLC) algorithms for a three-phase electrical grid. The presented system is enabled to track each harmonic order and sequence components with great robustness, extracting positive, negative, and zero sequence information from each harmonic for further filter selectivity. It also proposes a new strategy to improve the FLC-based algorithms in tracking frequencies in power grid disturbances. Simulated results of the algorithm and a real-time simulation of a selective active power filter (SAPF) were presented, validating the performance in several scenarios. "

Essential Oils of Alpinia nantoensis Retard Forskolin- Induced Melanogenesis via ERK1/2-Mediated Proteasomal Degradation of MITF,"The anti-melanogenic activity of essential oils of Alpinia nantoensis and their bioactive ingredients were investigated in vitro. Treatment with leaf (LEO) and rhizome (REO) essential oils of A. nantoensis, significantly reduced forskolin-induced melanin production followed by down-regulation of tyrosinase (TYR) and tyrosinase related protein-1 (TRP-1) expression at both transcriptional and translational levels. Further studies revealed that down-regulation TYR and TRP-1 were caused by LEO/REO-mediated suppression of Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), as evidenced by reduced nuclear translocation of MITF. Also, we found that LEO/REO induce the sustained activation of ERK1/2, which facilitate subsequent proteasomal degradation of MITF, as confirmed by that LEO/REO failed to inhibits MITF activity in ERK1/2 inhibitor treated cells. In addition, a significant increase of ubiquitinated MITF was observed after treatment with LEO and REO. Furthermore, the chemical composition of LEO and REO were characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) resulted that camphor, camphene, -pinene, -pinene, isoborneol and D-limonene were the major compounds in both LEO and REO. Further studies revealed that -pinene and D-limonene were the active components responsible for the anti-melanogenic properties of LEO and REO. Based on the results, this study provided a strong evidence that LEO and REO could be promising natural sources for the development of novel skin-whitening agents for the cosmetic purposes. "
Parameters for Irreversible Inactivation of Monoamine Oxidase,"The irreversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidases (MAO) slow neurotransmitter metabolism in depression and neurodegenerative diseases. After oxidation by MAO, hydrazines, cyclopropylamines and propargylamines form a covalent adduct with the flavin cofactor. To assist the design of new compounds to combat neurodegeneration, we have updated the kinetic parameters defining the interaction of these established drugs with human MAO-A and MAO-B and analyzed the required features. The Ki values for binding to MAO-A and molecular models show that selectivity is determined by the initial reversible binding. Common to all the irreversible inhibitor classes, the non-covalent 3D-chemical interactions depend on a H-bond donor and hydrophobic-aromatic features within 5.7 angstroms apart and an ionizable amine. Increasing hydrophobic interactions with the aromatic cage through aryl halogenation is important for stabilizing ligands in the binding site for transformation. Good and poor inactivators were investigated using visible spectroscopy and molecular dynamics. The initial binding, close and correctly oriented to the FAD, is important for the oxidation, specifically at the carbon adjacent to the propargyl group. The molecular dynamics study also provides evidence that retention of the allenyl imine product oriented towards FADH- influences the formation of the covalent adduct essential for effective inactivation of MAO.

"Divergence in Gut Bacterial Community Structure between Male and Female Stag Beetles Odontolabis fallaciosa (Coleoptera, Lucanidae)","Odontolabis fallaciosa (Coleoptera: Lucanidae) is a giant and popular stag beetle with striking sexual dimorphism and male trimorphism. However, little is known about their intestinal microbiota, which might play an indispensable role in shaping the health of their hosts. The aim of this study was to investigate the intestinal bacterial community structure between the two sexes and among three male morphs of O. fallaciosa from China using high-throughput sequencing (Illumina MiSeq). The gut bacterial community structure was significantly different between males and females, suggesting that sex appeared to be the crucial factor shaping the intestinal bacterial community. Females had higher bacterial alpha-diversity than males. There was little difference in gut bacterial community structure among the three male morphs. However, compared to medium and small males, large individuals were associated with the higher relative abundance of Firmicutes and Firmicutes/Bacteroides (F/B) ratio, which might contribute to nutritional efficiency. Overall, these results might help to further our understanding of beetle–bacterial interactions of O. fallaciosa between the two sexes, and among the three male morphs. "
Human Astrocytes Model Derived from Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells,"Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based disease modeling has a great potential for uncovering the mechanisms of pathogenesis, especially in the case of neurodegenerative diseases where disease-susceptible cells can usually not be obtained from patients. So far, the iPSC-based modeling of neurodegenerative diseases has mainly focused on neurons because the protocols for generating astrocytes from iPSCs have not been fully established. The growing evidence of astrocytes’ contribution to neurodegenerative diseases has underscored the lack of iPSC-derived astrocyte models. In the present study, we established a protocol to efficiently generate iPSC-derived astrocytes (iPasts), which were further characterized by RNA and protein expression profiles as well as functional assays. iPasts exhibited calcium dynamics and glutamate uptake activity comparable to human primary astrocytes. Moreover, when co-cultured with neurons, iPasts enhanced neuronal synaptic maturation. Our protocol can be used for modeling astrocyte-related disease phenotypes in vitro and further exploring the contribution of astrocytes to neurodegenerative diseases. "
Differential Effects of IGF-1R Small Molecule Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors BMS-754807 and OSI-906 on Human Cancer Cell Lines,"We have determined the effects of the IGF-1R tyrosine kinase inhibitors BMS-754807 (BMS) and OSI-906 (OSI) on cell proliferation and cell-cycle phase distribution in human colon, pancreatic carcinoma, and glioblastoma cell lines and primary cultures. IGF-1R signaling was blocked by BMS and OSI at equivalent doses, although both inhibitors exhibited differential antiproliferative effects. In all pancreatic carcinoma cell lines tested, BMS exerted a strong antiproliferative effect, whereas OSI had a minimal effect. Similar results were obtained on glioblastoma primary cultures, where HGUE-GB-15, -16 and -17 displayed resistance to OSI effects, whereas they were inhibited in their proliferation by BMS. Differential effects of BMS and OSI were also observed in colon carcinoma cell lines. Both inhibitors also showed different effects on cell cycle phase distribution, BMS induced G2/M arrest followed by cell death, while OSI induced G1 arrest with no cell death. Both inhibitors also showed different effects on other protein kinases activities. Taken together, our results are indicative that BMS mainly acts through off-target effects exerted on other protein kinases. Given that BMS exhibits a potent antiproliferative effect, we believe that this compound could be useful for the treatment of different types of tumors independently of their IGF-1R activation status.

REDD1 Is Involved in Amyloid -Induced Synaptic Dysfunction and Memory Impairment,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by neurological dysfunction, including memory impairment, attributed to the accumulation of amyloid  (A) in the brain. Although several studies reported possible mechanisms involved in A pathology, much remains unknown. Previous findings suggested that a protein regulated in development and DNA damage response 1 (REDD1), a stress-coping regulator, is an A-responsive gene involved in A cytotoxicity. However, we still do not know how A increases the level of REDD1 and whether REDD1 mediates A-induced synaptic dysfunction. To elucidate this, we examined the effect of A on REDD1-expression using acute hippocampal slices from mice, and the effect of REDD1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) on A-induced synaptic dysfunction. Lastly, we observed the effect of REDD1 shRNA on memory deficit in an AD-like mouse model. Through the experiments, we found that A-incubated acute hippocampal slices showed increased REDD1 levels. Moreover, A injection into the lateral ventricle increased REDD1 levels in the hippocampus. Anisomycin, but not actinomycin D, blocked A-induced increase in REDD1 levels in the acute hippocampal slices, suggesting that A may increase REDD1 translation rather than transcription. A activated Fyn/ERK/S6 cascade, and inhibitors for Fyn/ERK/S6 or mGluR5 blocked A-induced REDD1 upregulation. REDD1 inducer, a transcriptional activator, and A blocked synaptic plasticity in the acute hippocampal slices. REDD1 inducer inhibited mTOR/Akt signaling. REDD1 shRNA blocked A-induced synaptic deficits. REDD1 shRNA also blocked A-induced memory deficits in passive-avoidance and object-recognition tests. Collectively, these results demonstrate that REDD1 participates in A pathology and could be a target for AD therapy. "
Prognostic Significance of COX-2 Overexpression in BRAF-Mutated Middle Eastern Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma,"The cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)–prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) pathway has been implicated in carcinogenesis, with BRAF mutation shown to promote PGE2 synthesis. This study was conducted to evaluate COX-2 expression in a large cohort of Middle Eastern papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), and further evaluate the prognostic significance of COX-2 expression in strata of BRAF mutation status. BRAF mutation analysis was performed using Sanger sequencing, and COX-2 expression was evaluated immunohistochemically using tissue microarray (TMA). COX-2 overexpression, noted in 43.2% (567/1314) of cases, was significantly associated with poor prognostic markers such as extra-thyroidal extension, lymph-node metastasis, and higher tumor stage. COX-2 was also an independent predictor of poor disease-free survival (DFS). Most notably, the association of COX-2 expression with DFS differed by BRAF mutation status. COX-2 overexpression was associated with poor DFS in BRAF-mutant but not BRAF wild-type PTCs, with a multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio of 2.10 (95% CI "
Club Cell Secreted Protein CC16: Potential Applications in Prognosis and Therapy for Pulmonary Diseases,"Club cell secretory protein (CC16) is encoded by the SCGB1A1 gene. It is also known as CC10, secretoglobin, or uteroglobin. CC16 is a 16 kDa homodimeric protein secreted primarily by the non-ciliated bronchial epithelial cells, which can be detected in the airways, circulation, sputum, nasal fluid, and urine. The biological activities of CC16 and its pathways have not been completely understood, but many studies suggest that CC16 has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects. The human CC16 gene is located on chromosome 11, p12-q13, where several regulatory genes of allergy and inflammation exist. Studies reveal that factors such as gender, age, obesity, renal function, diurnal variation, and exercise regulate CC16 levels in circulation. Current findings indicate CC16 not only may reflect the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases, but also could serve as a potential biomarker in several lung diseases and a promising treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this review, we summarize our current understanding of CC16 in pulmonary diseases. "
Clonal Analysis of Gliogenesis in the Cerebral Cortex Reveals Stochastic Expansion of Glia and Cell Autonomous Responses to Egfr Dosage,"Development of the nervous system undergoes important transitions, including one from neurogenesis to gliogenesis which occurs late during embryonic gestation. Here we report on clonal analysis of gliogenesis in mice using Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers (MADM) with quantitative and computational methods. Results reveal that developmental gliogenesis in the cerebral cortex occurs in a fraction of earlier neurogenic clones, accelerating around E16.5, and giving rise to both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Moreover, MADM-based genetic deletion of the epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) in gliogenic clones revealed that Egfr is cell autonomously required for gliogenesis in the mouse dorsolateral cortices. A broad range in the proliferation capacity, symmetry of clones, and competitive advantage of MADM cells was evident in clones that contained one cellular lineage with double dosage of Egfr relative to their environment, while their sibling Egfr-null cells failed to generate glia. Remarkably, the total numbers of glia in MADM clones balance out regardless of significant alterations in clonal symmetries. The variability in glial clones shows stochastic patterns that we define mathematically, which are different from the deterministic patterns in neuronal clones. This study sets a foundation for studying the biological significance of stochastic and deterministic clonal principles underlying tissue development, and identifying mechanisms that differentiate between neurogenesis and gliogenesis.

Constraint on Hybrid Stars with Gravitational Wave Events,"Motivated by the recent discoveries of compact objects from LIGO/Virgo observations, we study the possibility of identifying some of these objects as compact stars made of dark matter called dark stars, or the mix of dark and nuclear matters called hybrid stars. In particular, in GW190814, a new compact object with 2.6 M is reported. This could be the lightest black hole, the heaviest neutron star, and a dark or hybrid star. In this work, we extend the discussion on the interpretations of the recent LIGO/Virgo events as hybrid stars made of various self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) in the isotropic limit. We pay particular attention to the saddle instability of the hybrid stars which will constrain the possible SIDM models.  "
Sensitive and In Situ Hemoglobin Detection Based on a Graphene Oxide Functionalized Microfiber,"The determination of hemoglobin (Hb) level is indispensable in the pathological study of many blood diseases. Graphene oxide (GO), with its excellent optical properties and great biocompatibility, has attracted significant attention and been widely utilized in biochemical detection. Here, we report an ultrasensitive Hb sensor based on a graphene oxide (GO)-coated microfiber. The GO was utilized as a linking layer deposited on the microfiber surface, which can provide an enhanced local evanescent light field and abundant bonding sites for Hb molecules. The optical microfiber with a compact structure and a strong evanescent light field served as the platform for biosensing. The surface morphology characterized by optical microscope, scanning electron microscope, and Raman spectroscopy offers detailed evidence for the success of GO deposition. The dynamic bonding between GO and target Hb molecules was monitored in real-time through an optical spectrum analyzer. An ultrahigh sensitivity of 6.02 nm/(mg/mL) with a detection limit of 0.17 g/mL was achieved by tracking the resonant wavelength shift of spectra. It is important to highlight that the detection limit of GO-coated microfiber is 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than other reported fiber optic Hb sensors. Benefiting from high sensitivity, low cost, small size, and fast response, the proposed sensing microfiber coated with GO could be a competitive alternative in the diagnosis of blood diseases and a subject of further research in the medical field.

In-Depth Analysis of Genetic Variation Associated with Severe West Nile Viral Disease,"West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne virus which causes symptomatic disease in a minority of infected humans. To identify novel genetic variants associated with severe disease, we utilized data from an existing case-control study of WNV and included population controls for an expanded analysis. We conducted imputation and gene-gene interaction analysis in the largest and most comprehensive genetic study conducted to date for West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WNND). Within the imputed West Nile virus dataset (severe cases n "
Potentiality of Self-Cloned Lactobacillus plantarum Taj-Apis362 for Enhancing GABA Production in Yogurt under Glucose Induction: Optimization and Its Cardiovascular Effect on Spontaneous Hypertensive Rats,"The current study evaluated the -aminobutyric acid (GABA) producing ability from three novel strains of lactic acid bacteria (L. plantarum Taj-Apis362, assigned as UPMC90, UPMC91, and UPMC1065) co-cultured with starter culture in a yogurt. A combination of UPMC90 + UPMC91 with starter culture symbiotically revealed the most prominent GABA-producing effect. Response surface methodology revealed the optimized fermentation conditions at 39.0 C, 7.25 h, and 11.5 mM glutamate substrate concentration to produce GABA-rich yogurt (29.96 mg/100 g) with desirable pH (3.93) and water-holding capacity (63.06%). At 2% glucose to replace pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP), a cofactor typically needed during GABA production, GABA content was further enhanced to 59.00 mg/100 g. In vivo study using this sample revealed a blood pressure-lowering efficacy at 0.1 mg/kg GABA dosage (equivalent to 30 mg/kg GABA-rich yogurt) in spontaneously hypertensive rats. An improved method to produce GABA-rich yogurt has been established, involving shorter fermentation time and lower glutamate concentration than previous work, along with glucose induction that omits the use of costly PLP, fostering the potential of developing a GABA-rich functional dairy product through natural fermentation with desirable product quality and antihypertensive property. "
Influence of Water on the Oxidation of NO on Pd/TiO2 Photocatalysts,"Two series of new photocatalysts were synthesized based on modification with Pd of the commercial P25 photocatalyst (EVONIK®). Two techniques were employed to incorporate Pd nanoparticles on the P25 surface: photodeposition (series Pd-P) and impregnation (series Pd-I). Both series were characterized in depth using a variety of instrumental techniques: BET, DRS, XRD, XPS, TEM, FTIR and FESEM. The modified series exhibited a significant change in pore size distribution, but no differences compared to the original P25 with respect to crystalline phase ratio or particle size were observed. The Pd0 oxidation state was predominant in the Pd-P series, while the presence of the Pd2+ oxidation state was additionally observed in the Pd-I series. The photoactivity tests were performed in a continuous photoreactor with the photocatalysts deposited, by dip-coating, on borosilicate glass plates. A total of 500 ppb of NO was used as input flow at a volumetric flow rate of 1.2 Lmin-1, and different relative humidities from 0 to 65% were tested. The results obtained show that under UV-vis or Vis radiation, the presence of Pd nanoparticles favors NO removal independently of the Pd incorporation method employed and independently of the tested relative humidity conditions. This improvement seems to be related to the different interaction of the water with the surface of the photocatalysts in the presence or absence of Pd. It was found in the catalyst without Pd that disproportionation of NO2 is favored through its reaction with water, with faster surface saturation. In contrast, in the catalysts with Pd, disproportionation took place through nitro-chelates and adsorbed NO2 formed from the photocatalytic oxidation of the NO. This different mechanism explains the greater efficiency in NOx removal in the catalysts with Pd. Comparing the two series of catalysts with Pd, Pd-P and Pd-I, greater activity of the Pd-P series was observed under both UV-vis and Vis radiation. It was shown that the Pd0 oxidation state is responsible for this greater activity as the Pd-I series improves its activity in successive cycles due to a reduction in Pd2+ species during the photoactivity tests.

What Types of Greenspaces Are Associated with Depression in Urban and Rural Older Adults? A Multilevel Cross-Sectional Study from JAGES,"Depression in older adults is a public health challenge. We aimed to clarify the relationship between depression in older adults and three types of neighborhood greenspaces: trees, grasslands, and fields. We utilized data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES) performed in 2016. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was used for non-stratified and stratified analyses for the urban–rural regions. The target population comprised 126,878 older adults (age  65 years) who responded to the depression questions and were living in 881 neighborhoods in Japan. Depression was diagnosed based on a Geriatric Depression Scale score 5, and 20.4% of the study population had depression. In the pre-stratification analysis, areas with more greenspaces revealed lower odds of depression (odds ratio (OR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85–0.95). In urban areas, more trees correlated with lower odds of depression (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89–1.00). In rural areas, moderate amounts of grassland were associated with lower odds of depression compared to areas with fewer grasslands (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83–1.00). We found that urban areas with higher tree density and rural areas with moderate amounts of grassland were associated with lower odds of depression. "

Combining a Matheuristic with Simulation for Risk Management of Stochastic Assets and Liabilities," Specially in the case of scenarios under uncertainty, the efficient management of risk when matching assets and liabilities is a relevant issue for most insurance companies. This paper considers such a scenario, where different assets can be aggregated to better match a liability (or the other way around), and the goal is to find the asset-liability assignments that maximises the overall benefit over a time horizon. To solve this stochastic optimisation problem, a simulation-optimisation methodology is proposed. We use integer programming to generate efficient asset-to-liability assignments, and Monte-Carlo simulation is employed to estimate the risk of failing to pay due liabilities. The simulation results allow us to set a safety margin parameter for the integer program, which encourage the generation of solutions satisfying a minimum reliability threshold. A series of computational experiments contribute to illustrate the proposed methodology and its utility in practical risk management.  "
Prevention of Microsphere Blockage in Catheter Tubes Using Convex Air Bubbles,"This paper presents a novel method to prevent blockages by embolic microspheres in catheter channels by using convex air bubbles attached to the channels’ inner wall surface. The  clogging by microspheres can occur by the arching of the microspheres in the catheter. A  few studies have been done on reducing the blockage, but their methods are not suitable for use with embolic catheters. In  this study, straight catheter channels were fabricated. They had cavities to form convex air bubbles; additionally, a straight channel without the cavities was designed for comparison. Blockage was observed in the straight channel without the cavities, and the blockage arching angle was measured to be 70, while no blockage occurred in the cavity channel with air bubbles, even at a geometrical arching angle of 85. The convex air bubbles have an important role in preventing blockages by microspheres. The slip effect on the air bubble surface and the centrifugal effect make the microspheres drift away from the channel wall.   was observed that as the size of the cavity was increased, the  drift distance became larger. Additionally, as  more convex air bubbles were formed, the amount of early drift to the center increased. It will be advantageous to design a catheter with large cavities that have a small interval between them. "
Neuroprotective Effect of Cudrania tricuspidata Fruit Extracts on Scopolamine-Induced Learning and Memory Impairment,"Cudrania tricuspidata has diverse biological activities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and neuroprotective effects. This study investigated the protective effects of C. tricuspidata fruit extracts (CTFE) against scopolamine (SCO)-induced neuron impairment. The neuroprotective effects of CTFE on SCO-induced memory dysfunction were confirmed in mice using the Barnes maze test. The results showed that co-treatment of SCO and CTFE increased the stay time in the target zone compared with SCO treatment alone. Similarly, the results obtained by the fear conditioning test revealed that SCO-CTFE co-treatment induced the freezing action time under both the contextual fear condition and the cued fear condition compared with SCO treatment alone. Moreover, we showed that CTFE reduced the SCO-induced acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, thereby increasing the acetylcholine concentration in mice hippocampal tissues. Consistent with the improvement of memory and recognition function in vivo, our in vitro results showed that CTFE induced cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activity in PC12 cells and reduced SCO-induced AChE activity. In addition, the microarray results of the hippocampal tissue support our data showing that CTFE affects gene expressions associated with neurogenesis and neuronal cell differentiation markers such as spp1 and klk6. Overall, CTFE exerts a neuroprotective effect via regulation of the CREB and ERK1/2 signaling pathways and could be a therapeutic candidate for neurodegenerative diseases. "
Evidence of Hepatitis E Virus in Goat and Sheep Milk,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the etiological agent behind hepatitis E infection. Domestic pigs and wild boars are the main animal reservoirs of HEV. Very few papers describe HEV infection in goats and sheep. As the data pertaining to the presence of HEV virus in the milk of small ruminants in Europe are lacking, the aim of this paper was to examine a representative number of milk samples from these animals. The detection of HEV genome (HEV RNA) was performed using reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). HEV RNA was found in 2.8% of the examined samples. Positivity ranged from 101 to 103 genome equivalents/mL (GE/mL) with a median of 9.99  102 GE/mL. On the basis of these results, the milk of small ruminants could represent a source of HEV infection to consumers. "
Nature Inspired MIMO Antenna System for Future mmWave Technologies,"In this work, a new Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antenna system with a novel shape inspired by nature is proposed for Fifth-Generation (5G) communication systems. The antenna is designed on a Rogers 5880. The dielectric constant of the substrate is 2.2, and the loss tangent is assumed to be 0.0009. The gain of the system for the desired bandwidth is nearly 8 dB. The simulated and the measured efficiency of the proposed system is 95% and 80%, respectively. To demonstrate the capability of the system as a potential candidate for future 5G communication devices, MIMO key performance parameters such as the Envelope Correlation Coefficient (ECC) and Diversity Gain (DG) are computed. It is found that the proposed system has low ECC, constant DG, and high efficiency for the desired bandwidth.  "
Regulatory T Cell Stability and Plasticity in Atherosclerosis,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) express the lineage-defining transcription factor FoxP3 and play crucial roles in self-tolerance and immune homeostasis. Thymic tTregs are selected based on affinity for self-antigens and are stable under most conditions. Peripheral pTregs differentiate from conventional CD4 T cells under the influence of TGF- and other cytokines and are less stable. Treg plasticity refers to their ability to inducibly express molecules characteristic of helper CD4 T cell lineages like T-helper (Th)1, Th2, Th17 or follicular helper T cells. Plastic Tregs retain FoxP3 and are thought to be specialized regulators for “their” lineage. Unstable Tregs lose FoxP3 and switch to become exTregs, which acquire pro-inflammatory T-helper cell programs. Atherosclerosis with systemic hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, inflammatory cytokines, and local hypoxia provides an environment that is likely conducive to Tregs switching to exTregs. "
The Role of Mitochondria in Brain Cell Protection from Ischaemia by Differently Prepared Propolis Extracts,"Mitochondria are both the primary targets and mediators of ischaemic damage in brain cells. Insufficient oxygen causes reactive oxygen species that damage the mitochondria, leading to the loss of functionality and viability of highly energy-demanding neurons. We have recently found that aqueous (AqEP), polyethylene glycol-aqueous (Pg-AqEP) and ethanolic propolis extracts (EEP) can modulate mitochondria and ROS production in C6 cells of astrocytic origin. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the extracts on viability, mitochondrial efficiency and superoxide generation, and inflammatory cytokine release in primary rat cerebellar neuronal-glial cell cultures affected by ischaemia (mimicked by hypoxia +/- deoxyglucose). AqEP and Pg-AqEP (15–60 g/mL of phenolic compounds, or PC) significantly increased neuronal viability in ischaemia-treated cultures, and this was accompanied by a reduction in mitochondrial superoxide levels. Less extended protection against ischaemia-induced superoxide production and death was exhibited by 2 to 4 g/mL of PC EEP. Both Pg-AqEP and Ag-EP (but not EEP) significantly protected the cultures from hypoxia-induced elevation of TNF-, IL-1 and IL-6. Only Pg-AqEP (but not AqEP or EEP) prevented hypoxia-induced loss of the mitochondrial basal and ATP-coupled respiration rate, and significantly increased the mitochondrial respiratory capacity. Summarising, the study revealed that hydrophilic propolis extracts might protect brain cells against ischaemic injury by decreasing the level of mitochondrial superoxide and preventing inflammatory cytokines, and, in the case of Pg-AqEP, by protecting mitochondrial function. "
Obstruction of the Hepatic Venous Flow Caused by Intravenous Leiomyomatosis,"Budd–Chiari syndrome (BCS) is a rare intrahepatic vascular disease that is characterized by a hepatic venous outflow obstruction. Intravenous leiomyomatosis (ILs) is a rare complication of a myoma. Here, we report a case of BCS that was caused by intracaval ILs. A woman presented to the emergency department (ED) with abdominal distension that had gradually progressed over a period of 3 years. Bedside ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) showed a large ascites and pelvic mass. The mass continued to the inferior vena cava and the right atrium. The intracaval mass was obstructing the left and middle hepatic veins. We established a tentative diagnosis of BCS caused by intracaval ILs and attempted surgical resection. Complete resection of the intracaval mass failed because of adhesion; however, she was discharged from the hospital without any postoperative complications. After 3 months, a pelvic ultrasonography showed a recurrence of a 4  3-cm pelvic mass. The mass size increased to 6 cm after 30 months. ILs can cause secondary BCS and can lead to life-threatening conditions. Owing to its extreme rarity, early detection in the ED is challenging. Bedside ultrasonography and CECT can enable the early recognition of BCS by ILs. "
Marine-Derived Chitosan Nanoparticles Improved the Intestinal Histo-Morphometrical Features in Association with the Health and Immune Response of Grey Mullet (Liza ramada),"Marine-derived substances are known for their beneficial influences on aquatic animals’ performances and are recommended to improve intestinal health, immunity, and anti-oxidative status. The present study investigates the role of chitosan nanoparticles on the intestinal histo-morphometrical features in association with the health and immune response of Grey Mullet (Liza ramada). Chitosan nanoparticles are included in the diets at 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 g/kg and introduced to fish in a successive feeding trial for eight weeks. The final body weight (FBW), weight gain (WG), and specific growth rate (SGR) parameters are significantly increased while feed conversion ratio (FCR) decreases by chitosan nanoparticles compared to the control (p < 0.05). The morphometric analysis of the intestines reveals a significant improvement in villus height, villus width, and the number of goblet cells in chitosan-treated groups in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, there is a positive correlation between the thickness of the enterocyte brush border and the chitosan dose, referring to an increasing absorptive activity. Histologically, the intestinal wall of Grey Mullet consists of four layers; mucosa, sub-mucosa, tunica muscularis (muscular layers), and serosa. The histological examination of the L. ramada intestine shows a normal histo-morphology. The epithelial layer of intestinal mucosa is thrown into elongated finger-like projections, the intestinal villi. The values of hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cells (RBCs), total protein (TP), albumin, and globulin are significantly increased in fish fed 1, and 2 g/kg of chitosan nanoparticles compared to fish fed 0 and 0.5 g/kg (p < 0.05). The highest levels of TP and albumin are observed in fish fed 1 g/kg diet (p < 0.05). The lysozyme activity and phagocytic index are significantly enhanced by feeding chitosan nanoparticles at 0.5, 1, and 2 g/kg, whereas the phagocytic activity is improved in fish fed 1 and 2 g/kg (p < 0.05). The highest lysozyme activity and phagocytic index are observed in fish fed 1 g/kg. SOD is significantly activated by feeding chitosan nanoparticles at 1 g/kg. Simultaneously, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) activities also are enhanced by feeding chitosan at 1 and 2 g/kg, compared to fish fed 0 and 0.5 g/kg (p < 0.05). The highest GPx and CAT activities are observed in fish fed 1 g/kg (p < 0.05). Conversely, the malondialdehyde (MDA) levels are decreased by feeding chitosan at 1 and 2 g/kg, with the lowest being in fish fed 1 g/kg (p < 0.05). To summarize, the results elucidate that L. ramada fed dietary chitosan nanoparticles have a marked growth rate, immune response, and anti-oxidative response. These improvements are attributed to the potential role of chitosan nanoparticles in enhancing intestinal histo-morphometry and intestinal health. These results soundly support the possibility of using chitosan nanoparticles at 1–2 g/kg as a feasible functional supplement for aquatic animals. "
The Role of Epigenomics in Osteoporosis and Osteoporotic Vertebral Fracture,"Osteoporosis is a complex multifactorial condition of the musculoskeletal system. Osteoporosis and osteoporotic vertebral fracture (OVF) are associated with high medical costs and can lead to poor quality of life. Genetic factors are important in determining bone mass and structure, as well as any predisposition for bone degradation and OVF. However, genetic factors are not enough to explain osteoporosis development and OVF occurrence. Epigenetics describes a mechanism for controlling gene expression and cellular processes without altering DNA sequences. The main mechanisms in epigenetics are DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Recently, alterations in epigenetic mechanisms and their activity have been associated with osteoporosis and OVF. Here, we review emerging evidence that epigenetics contributes to the machinery that can alter DNA structure, gene expression, and cellular differentiation during physiological and pathological bone remodeling. A progressive understanding of normal bone metabolism and the role of epigenetic mechanisms in multifactorial osteopathy can help us better understand the etiology of the disease and convert this information into clinical practice. A deep understanding of these mechanisms will help in properly coordinating future individual treatments of osteoporosis and OVF. "
Machine Learning-Assisted High-Throughput Molecular Dynamics Simulation of High-Mechanical Performance Carbon Nanotube Structure,"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are novel materials with extraordinary mechanical properties. To gain insight on the design of high-mechanical-performance CNT-reinforced composites, the optimal structure of CNTs with high nominal tensile strength was determined in this study, where the nominal values correspond to the cross-sectional area of the entire specimen, including the hollow core. By using machine learning-assisted high-throughput molecular dynamics (HTMD) simulation, the relationship among the following structural parameters/properties was investigated: diameter, number of walls, chirality, and crosslink density. A database, comprising the various tensile test simulation results, was analyzed using a self-organizing map (SOM). It was observed that the influence of crosslink density on the nominal tensile strength tends to gradually decrease from the outside to the inside; generally, the crosslink density between the outermost wall and its adjacent wall is highly significant. In particular, based on our calculation conditions, five-walled, armchair-type CNTs with an outer diameter of 43.39 Å and crosslink densities (between the inner wall and outer wall) of 1.38  1.16%, 1.13  0.69%, 1.54  0.57%, and 1.36  0.35% were believed to be the optimal structure, with the nominal tensile strength and nominal Young’s modulus reaching approximately 58–64 GPa and 677–698 GPa.

Could Cognitive Behavioural Therapy Be an Effective Treatment for Long COVID and Post COVID-19 Fatigue Syndrome? Lessons from the Qure Study for Q-Fever Fatigue Syndrome,"An increasing number of young and previously fit and healthy people who did not require hospitalisation continue to have symptoms months after mild cases of COVID-19. Rehabilitation clinics are already offering cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) as an effective treatment for long COVID and post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome based on the claims that it is effective for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)—the most common post-infectious syndrome—as no study into the efficacy of CBT for post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome has been published. Re-analyses of these studies, however, showed that CBT did not lead to objective improvements in heterogeneous groups of ME/CFS patients, nor did it restore the ability to work. The group of patients with long COVID and post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome, on the other hand, is homogeneous. We therefore analysed the Dutch Qure study, as it studied the efficacy of CBT in a homogeneous group of patients who developed Q-fever fatigue syndrome—which affects up to 30% of patients—after the largest reported outbreak of Q-fever, to see if CBT might potentially be an effective treatment for long-haulers after COVID-19 infection. Our reanalysis found that the Qure study suffered from many serious methodological problems, which included relying on one subjective primary outcome in a study without a control group for the non-blinded CBT treatment group, using a post hoc definition of improvement, waiting 2 years before publishing their objective actometer results and ignoring the null effect of said results. Moreover, only 10% of participants achieved a clinically meaningful subjective improvement in fatigue as a result of CBT according to the study’s own figures. Consequently, CBT has no subjective clinically meaningful effect in nine out of every ten patients that are treated with it. Additionally, the subjective improvement in fatigue was not matched by an improvement in disability, even though the disability was fatigue related according to the researchers. On top of this, CBT did not lead to an objective improvement in physical performance. Therefore, it cannot be said that CBT is an effective treatment for Q-fever fatigue syndrome either. It seems therefore unlikely that CBT will reduce disability or lead to objective improvement in long COVID or in post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome. "

Paecilomyces and Its Importance in the Biological Control of Agricultural Pests and Diseases,"Incorporating beneficial microorganisms in crop production is the most promising strategy for maintaining agricultural productivity and reducing the use of inorganic fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides. Numerous microorganisms have been described in the literature as biological control agents for pests and diseases, although some have not yet been commercialised due to their lack of viability or efficacy in different crops. Paecilomyces is a cosmopolitan fungus that is mainly known for its nematophagous capacity, but it has also been reported as an insect parasite and biological control agent of several fungi and phytopathogenic bacteria through different mechanisms of action. In addition, species of this genus have recently been described as biostimulants of plant growth and crop yield. This review includes all the information on the genus Paecilomyces as a biological control agent for pests and diseases. Its growth rate and high spore production rate in numerous substrates ensures the production of viable, affordable, and efficient commercial formulations for agricultural use. "
Stress Whitening as an Observation Method of Residual Stress in MABS Polymer Material through the Example of Holding Pressure in an Injection Molding Process,"The effects such as warpage, dimensional instability and environmental stress corrosion, due to the presence of residual stresses in polymeric products, are strongly dependent on injection molding conditions. the holding time and holding pressure belongs to most important processing parameters, determining the dimensional stability and properties of injected goods. A new procedure based on a visualization technique was applied, where the levels of residual stresses of the samples were estimated. the experiments were performed for samples produced of translucent methacrylate acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (MABS), a commodity polymer with a high transparency, necessary for the optical visualization of the stress whitening. the samples produced by injecting molding were deformed to a constant elongation, to observe the dependent stress whitening effect subsequently used to evaluate the stress distribution. It was found that depending on the value of the injection holding pressure, various levels of residual stress and its distribution may be observed in MABS samples. The se measurements conformed that the applied optical method is an easy-to-perform technique. the possibility to detect the residual stresses over the whole cross-section of the transparent product, without the necessity for local stress determination, is another significant advantage of this investigation procedure.

Filling the Void: An Optimized Polymicrobial Interkingdom Biofilm Model for Assessing Novel Antimicrobial Agents in Endodontic Infection,"There is a growing realization that endodontic infections are often polymicrobial, and may contain Candida spp. Despite this understanding, the development of new endodontic irrigants and models of pathogenesis remains limited to mono-species biofilm models and is bacterially focused. The purpose of this study was to develop and optimize an interkingdom biofilm model of endodontic infection and use this to test suitable anti-biofilm actives. Biofilms containing Streptococcus gordonii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Candida albicans were established from ontological analysis. Biofilms were optimized in different media and atmospheric conditions, prior to quantification and imaging, and subsequently treated with chlorhexidine, EDTA, and chitosan. These studies demonstrated that either media supplemented with serum were equally optimal for biofilm growth, which were dominated by S. gordonii, followed by C. albicans. Assessment of antimicrobial activity showed significant effectiveness of each antimicrobial, irrespective of serum. Chitosan was most effective (3 log reduction), and preferentially targeted C. albicans in both biofilm treatment and inhibition models. Chitosan was similarly effective at preventing biofilm growth on a dentine substrate. This study has shown that a reproducible and robust complex interkingdom model, which when tested with the antifungal chitosan, supports the notion of C. albicans as a key structural component. "
Improvement in the Pharmacological Profile of Copper Biological Active Complexes by Their Incorporation into Organic or Inorganic Matrix,"Every year, more Cu(II) complexes are proven to be biologically active species, but very few are developed as drugs or entered in clinical trials. This is due to their poor water solubility and lipophilicity, low stability as well as in vivo inactivation. The possibility to improve their pharmacological and/or oral administration profile by incorporation into inorganic or organic matrix was studied. Most of them are either physically encapsulated or conjugated to the matrix via a moiety able to coordinate Cu(II). As a result, a large variety of species were developed as delivery carriers. The organic carriers include liposomes, synthetic or natural polymers or dendrimers, while the inorganic ones are based on carbon nanotubes, hydrotalcite and silica. Some hybrid organic-inorganic materials based on alginate-carbonate, gold-PEG and magnetic mesoporous silica-Schiff base were also developed for this purpose. "
Dental Care Access and the Elderly: What Is the Role of Teledentistry? A Systematic Review,"A high level of unmet oral health needs is very common among elderly people. In a society that is getting older and that has been hit so hard by the coronavirus pandemic, the development of new strategies aimed at enhancing general and oral health status should be crucial in order to promote healthy aging. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the feasibility of Teledentistry in communities or in a domiciliary setting where elderly people live. A structured and systematic research was performed on the major electronic databases for studies published in English until 30 June 2020: the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL databases. A total of 13 articles were identified through database searching using combinations of keywords. Out of 13 papers, eight abstracts were reviewed to assess if they were coherent with the aim of the study, and full texts were retrieved. After abstract reviews, seven articles were selected for closer inspection. Of these, six were assessed for eligibility. Four papers were aimed at assessing patients and health practitioners experiences about Teledentistry, three studies reported a cost analysis and cost description of Teledentistry in residential aged care facilities, and two studies investigated the feasibility and accuracy of Teledentistry for diagnosis dental pathology. The implementation of Teledentistry in residential aged care facilities and in home-assistance programs could be a viable tool for the management of oral care in people who cannot access dental care.

Transport of Contamination under the Influence of Sea Level Rise in Coastal Heterogeneous Aquifer,"This paper provided for the first time an experimental study on the influence of sea level rise on transport of contamination in the heterogeneous unconfined aquifer of the coastal zone. The experiments were conducted using the tank, considering the difference between sea level and inland head 1 cm for Case 1 and 2 cm for Case 2. Observed data were validated using the numerical model, which matched well with the toe length of seawater wedge and the shape of the contaminant plume. The results showed that the observed and simulated values of Cl-  concentration at the sampling points increased sharply at the initial time, and then they increased slowly and tended to be stable. The seawater wedge migrated inland with time under the effects of the hydraulic gradient toward the inland and the density difference between saltwater and freshwater. The steady state length of the 50% isoline of the seawater wedge was 167 cm in Case 2, which was larger than that of Case 1. The maximum area of plume in Case 2 was 0.13 m2, larger than that in Case 1, which indicated that the velocity of diffusion of the contaminant plume increased as the sea level increased. As the velocity of diffusion increased, the time for pollutant migration to the intersection between seawater and freshwater became shorter. The maximum area and vertical depth of pollutant plume were sensitive to the hydraulic conductivity, dispersivity, and contamination concentration. The infiltration depth and range of the contaminant plume in the heterogeneous aquifer were greater than those in the homogeneous aquifer of the actual beach. "
The Influence of Physical Activity on The Bioactive Lipids Metabolism in Obesity-Induced Muscle Insulin Resistance,"High-fat diet consumption and lack of physical activity are important risk factors for metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and cardiovascular diseases. Insulin resistance is a state of a weakened response of tissues such as skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and liver to insulin, which causes an increase in blood glucose levels. This condition is The result of inhibition of The intracellular insulin signaling pathway. Skeletal muscle is an important insulin-sensitive tissue that accounts for about 80% of insulin-dependent glucose uptake. Although The exact mechanism by which insulin resistance is induced has not been thoroughly understood, it is known that insulin resistance is most commonly associated with obesity. Therefore, it is believed that lipids may play an important role in inducing insulin resistance. Among lipids, researchers’ attention is mainly focused on biologically active lipids: diacylglycerols (DAG) and ceramides. These lipids are able to regulate The activity of intracellular enzymes, including those involved in insulin signaling. Available data indicate that physical activity affects lipid metabolism and has a positive effect on insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscles. In This review, we have presented The current state of knowledge about The impact of physical activity on insulin resistance and metabolism of biologically active lipids. "
A State-Level Socioeconomic Data Collection of the United States for COVID-19 Research,"The outbreak of COVID-19 from late 2019 not only threatens the health and lives of humankind but impacts public policies, economic activities, and human behavior patterns significantly. To understand the impact and better prepare for future outbreaks, socioeconomic factors play significant roles in (1) determinant analysis with health care, environmental exposure and health behavior; (2) human mobility analyses driven by policies; (3) economic pressure and recovery analyses for decision making; and (4) short to long term social impact analysis for equity, justice and diversity. To support these analyses for rapid impact responses, state level socioeconomic factors for the United States of America (USA) are collected and integrated into topic-based indicators, including (1) the daily quantitative policy stringency index; (2) dynamic economic indices with multiple time frequency of GDP, international trade, personal income, employment, the housing market, and others; (3) the socioeconomic determinant baseline of the demographic, housing financial situation and medical resources. This paper introduces the measurements and metadata of relevant socioeconomic data collection, along with the sharing platform, data warehouse framework and quality control strategies. Different from existing COVID-19 related data products, this collection recognized the geospatial and dynamic factor as essential dimensions of epidemiologic research and scaled down the spatial resolution of socioeconomic data collection from country level to state level of the USA with a standard data format and high quality.

Pigs Overexpressing Porcine -Defensin 2 Display Increased Resilience to Glaesserella parasuis Infection,"As the causative agent of Glässer’s disease, Glaesserella (Haemophilus) parasuis has led to serious economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. Due to the low cross-protection of vaccines and increasing antimicrobial resistance of  G. parasuis, it is important to develop alternative approaches to prevent  G. parasuis infection. Defensins are host defense peptides that have been suggested to be promising substitutes for antibiotics in animal production, while porcine -defensin 2 (PBD-2) is a potent antimicrobial peptide discovered in pigs. Our previous study generated transgenic (TG) pigs overexpressing PBD-2, which displayed enhanced resistance to Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. In this study, the antibacterial activities of PBD-2 against  G. parasuis are determined in vitro and in the TG pig model. The concentration-dependent bactericidal activity of synthetic PBD-2 against  G. parasuis was measured by bacterial counting. Moreover, after being infected with  G. parasuis via a cohabitation challenge model, TG pigs overexpressing PBD-2 displayed significantly milder clinical signs and less severe gross pathological changes than their wild-type (WT) littermates. The TG pigs also exhibited alleviated lung and brain lesions, while bacterial loads in the lung and brain tissues of the TG pigs were significantly lower than those of the WT pigs. Additionally, lung and brain homogenates from TG pigs possessed enhanced antibacterial activity against  G. parasuis when compared with those from the WT pigs. Altogether, these proved that overexpression of PBD-2 could also endow pigs with increased resilience to  G. parasuis infection, which further confirmed the potential of using the PBD-2 coding gene to develop disease-resistant pigs and provided a novel strategy to combat  G. parasuis as well. "
New Insights on the Evolution of the Sweet Taste Receptor of Primates Adapted to Harsh Environments,"Taste perception is an essential function that provides valuable dietary and sensory information, which is crucial for the survival of animals. Studies into the evolution of the sweet taste receptor gene (TAS1R2) are scarce, especially for Bornean endemic primates such as Nasalis larvatus (proboscis monkey), Pongo pygmaeus (Bornean orangutan), and Hylobates muelleri (Muller’s Bornean gibbon). Primates are the perfect taxa to study as they are diverse dietary feeders, comprising specialist folivores, frugivores, gummivores, herbivores, and omnivores. We constructed phylogenetic trees of the TAS1R2 gene for 20 species of anthropoid primates using four different methods (neighbor-joining, maximum parsimony, maximum-likelihood, and Bayesian) and also established the time divergence of the phylogeny. The phylogeny successfully separated the primates into their taxonomic groups as well as by their dietary preferences. Of note, the reviewed time of divergence estimation for the primate speciation pattern in this study was more recent than the previously published estimates. It is believed that this difference may be due to environmental changes, such as food scarcity and climate change, during the late Miocene epoch, which forced primates to change their dietary preferences. These findings provide a starting point for further investigation. "
Derivation of Respiratory Metrics in Health and Asthma,"The ability to continuously monitor breathing metrics may have indications for general health as well as respiratory conditions such as asthma. However, few studies have focused on breathing due to a lack of available wearable technologies. To examine the performance of two machine learning algorithms in extracting breathing metrics from a finger-based pulse oximeter, which is amenable to long-term monitoring. Methods: Pulse oximetry data were collected from 11 healthy and 11 with asthma subjects who breathed at a range of controlled respiratory rates. U-shaped network (U-Net) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithms were applied to the data, and results compared against breathing metrics derived from respiratory inductance plethysmography measured simultaneously as a reference. Results: The LSTM vs. U-Net model provided breathing metrics which were strongly correlated with those from the reference signal (all p < 0.001, except for inspiratory: expiratory ratio). The following absolute mean bias (95% confidence interval) values were observed (in seconds): inspiration time 0.01(-2.31, 2.34) vs. -0.02(-2.19, 2.16), expiration time -0.19(-2.35, 1.98) vs. -0.24(-2.36, 1.89), and inter-breath intervals -0.19(-2.73, 2.35) vs. -0.25(2.76, 2.26). The inspiratory:expiratory ratios were -0.14(-1.43, 1.16) vs. -0.14(-1.42, 1.13). Respiratory rate (breaths per minute) values were 0.22(-2.51, 2.96) vs. 0.29(-2.54, 3.11). While percentage bias was low, the 95% limits of agreement was high (~35% for respiratory rate). Conclusion: Both machine learning models show strong correlation and good comparability with reference, with low bias though wide variability for deriving breathing metrics in asthma and health cohorts. Future efforts should focus on improvement of performance of these models, e.g., by increasing the size of the training dataset at the lower breathing rates. "
Yerba Mate Extract in Microfibrillated Cellulose and Corn Starch Films as a Potential Wound Healing Bandage,"Microfibrillated cellulose films have been gathering considerable attention due to their high mechanical properties and cheap cost. Additionally, it is possible to include compounds within the fibrillated structure in order to confer desirable properties. Ilex paraguariensis A. St.-Hil, yerba mate leaf extract has been reported to possess a high quantity of caffeoylquinic acids that may be beneficial for other applications instead of its conventional use as a hot beverage. Therefore, we investigate the effect of blending yerba mate extract during and after defibrillation of Eucalyptus sp. bleached kraft paper by ultrafine grinding. Blending the extract during defibrillation increased the mechanical and thermal properties, besides being able to use the whole extract. Afterwards, this material was also investigated with high content loadings of starch and glycerine. The results present that yerba mate extract increases film resistance, and the defibrillated cellulose is able to protect the bioactive compounds from the extract. Additionally, the films present antibacterial activity against two known pathogens S. aureus and E. coli, with high antioxidant activity and increased cell proliferation. This was attributed to the bioactive compounds that presented faster in vitro wound healing, suggesting that microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) films containing extract of yerba mate can be a potential alternative as wound healing bandages. "
Probing Magnetic Pulse Welding of Thin-Walled Tubes,"Magnetic pulse welding is a solid-state joining technology, based on the use of electromagnetic forces to deform and to weld workpieces. Since no external heat sources are used during the magnetic pulse welding process, it offers important advantages for the joining of dissimilar material combinations. Although magnetic pulse welding has emerged as a novel technique to join metallic tubes, the dimensional consistency of the joint assembly due to the strong impact of the flyer tube onto the target tube and the resulting plastic deformation is a major concern. Often, an internal support inside the target tube is considered as a solution to improve the stiffness of the joint assembly. A detailed investigation of magnetic pulse welding of Cu-DHP flyer tubes and 11SMnPb30 steel target tubes is performed, with and without an internal support inside the target tubes, and using a range of experimental conditions. The influence of the key process conditions on the evolution of the joint between the tubes with progress in time has been determined using experimental investigations and numerical modelling. As the process is extremely fast, real-time monitoring of the process conditions and evolution of important responses such as impact velocity and angle, and collision velocity, which determine the formation of a metallic bond, is impossible. Therefore, an integrated approach using a computational model using a finite-element method is developed to predict the progress of the impact of the flyer onto the target, the resulting flyer impact velocity and angle, the collision velocity between the flyer and the target, and the evolution of the welded joint, which are usually impossible to measure using experimental observations.

Lack of Interleukin-6 Affects IFN- and TNF- Production and Early In Vivo Control of Brucella abortus Infection,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine promptly produced in response to infections, which contributes to host defense through the stimulation of acute phase immune responses. Brucella abortus is an intracellular bacterium that causes chronic disease in humans and domestic animals and triggers a robust immune response, characterized by the production of inflammatory cytokines. However, the mechanisms of IL-6-related immune responses in the context of Brucella infections are not completely understood. In this report, we describe an increased susceptibility of IL-6 knockout (KO) mice in the early phase of Brucella infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that IL-6 is required for interferon (IFN)- and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- induction by infected splenocytes, indicating a protective role for IL-6 against B. abortus that parallels with Th1 type of immune response. Additionally, IL-6 KO mice exhibited reduced splenomegaly during the early phase of the infection. Corroborating this result, IL-6 KO mice displayed reduced numbers of macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils in the spleen and reduced myeloperoxidase activity in the liver compared to wild-type infected mice. However, we demonstrate that IL-6 is not involved in B. abortus intracellular restriction in mouse macrophages. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that IL-6 contributes to host resistance during the early phase of B. abortus infection in vivo, and suggest that its protective role maybe partially mediated by proinflammatory immune responses and immune cell recruitment.

Impact of Isolation Procedures on the Development of a Preclinical Synovial Fibroblasts/Macrophages in an In Vitro Model of Osteoarthritis,"There is a lack ofin vitromodels able to properly represent osteoarthritis (OA) synovial tissue (ST). We aimed to characterize OA ST and to investigate whether a mechanical or enzymatic digestion procedures influence synovial cell functional heterogeneity in vitro. Procedures using mechanical nondigested fragments (NDF), synovial digested fragments (SDF), and filtrated synovial digested cells (SDC) were compared. An immunophenotypic profile was performed to distinguish synovial fibroblasts (CD55, CD73, CD90, CD106), macrophages (CD14, CD68), M1-like (CD80, CD86), and M2-like (CD163, CD206) synovial macrophages. Pro-inflammatory (interleukin 6 IL6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), chemokine C-C motif ligand 3 (CCL3/MIP1), C-X- motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10/IP10) and anti-inflammatory (interleukin 10 (IL10)), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF1), C-C motif chemokine ligand 18 (CCL18) cytokines were evaluated. CD68 and CD163 markers were higher in NDF and SDF compared to the SDC procedure, while CD80, CD86, and CD206 were higher only in NDF compared to the SDC procedure. Synovial fibroblast markers showed similar percentages. TNF, CCL3/MIP1, CXCL10/IP10, and CCL18 were higher in NDF compared to SDC, but not compared to SDF. IL10 and TGF1 were higher in NDF than SDC at the molecular level, while IL6 did not show differences among procedures. We demonstrated that NDF isolation procedures better preserved the heterogeneity of specific OA synovial populations (fibroblasts, macrophages), fostering their use for testing new cell therapies or drugs for OA, reducing or avoiding the use of animal models.

THE ENERGY-DEPENDENT POSITION OF THE IBEX RIBBON DUE TO THE SOLAR WIND STRUCTURE,"The Astrophysical Journal, 827(2016) 71. doi:10.3847/0004-637X/827/1/71 "
Does Botulinum Toxin Treatment Affect the Ultrasonographic Characteristics of Post-Stroke Spastic Equinus? A Retrospective Pilot Study,"Equinovarus/equinus foot is a pattern most commonly treated with botulinum toxin type A in patients with post-stroke spasticity involving the lower limbs; the gastrocnemius is the muscle most frequently injected. Spastic equinovarus/equinus can present a mixture of conditions, including spasticity, muscle/tendon shortening, muscle weakness and imbalance. In this study, we wanted to determine whether botulinum toxin treatment affects the ultrasonographic characteristics of post-stroke spastic equinus. The same dose of AbobotulinumtoxinA was injected into the gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis of 21 chronic stroke patients with spastic equinus. Clinical (Ashworth scale and ankle range of motion) and ultrasound (conventional and sonoelastography) evaluation of the treated leg was carried out before and 4 weeks after injection. No significant effects of botulinum toxin treatment on the ultrasonographic characteristics of spastic equinus were observed. As expected, there were significant improvements in ankle passive dorsiflexion range of motion and calf muscle spasticity at 1 month after treatment. There was a direct association between Achilles tendon elasticity and calf muscle spasticity at baseline evaluation. Larger studies with a long-term timeline of serial evaluations are needed to further investigate the possible effects of botulinum toxin injection on spastic muscle characteristics in patients with post-stroke spasticity.

Genome-Wide Analysis of Off-Target CRISPR/Cas9 Activity in Single-Cell-Derived Human Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cell Clones,"CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9)-mediated genome editing holds remarkable promise for the treatment of human genetic diseases. However, the possibility of off-target Cas9 activity remains a concern. To address this issue using clinically relevant target cells, we electroporated Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes (independently targeted to two different genomic loci, the CXCR4 locus on chromosome 2 and the AAVS1 locus on chromosome 19) into human mobilized peripheral blood-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and assessed the acquisition of somatic mutations in an unbiased, genome-wide manner via whole genome sequencing (WGS) of single-cell-derived HSPC clones. Bioinformatic analysis identified >20,000 total somatic variants (indels, single nucleotide variants, and structural variants) distributed among Cas9-treated and non-Cas9-treated control HSPC clones. Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference in the number of novel non-targeted indels among the samples. Moreover, data analysis showed no evidence of Cas9-mediated indel formation at 623 predicted off-target sites. The median number of novel single nucleotide variants was slightly elevated in Cas9 RNP-recipient sample groups compared to baseline, but did not reach statistical significance. Structural variants were rare and demonstrated no clear causal connection to Cas9-mediated gene editing procedures. We find that the collective somatic mutational burden observed within Cas9 RNP-edited human HSPC clones is indistinguishable from naturally occurring levels of background genetic heterogeneity. "
Infrared and Visible Image Fusion Techniques Based on Deep Learning: A Review,"Infrared and visible image fusion technologies make full use of different image features obtained by different sensors, retain complementary information of the source images during the fusion process, and use redundant information to improve the credibility of the fusion image. In recent years, many researchers have used deep learning methods (DL) to explore the field of image fusion and found that applying DL has improved the time-consuming efficiency of the model and the fusion effect. However, DL includes many branches, and there is currently no detailed investigation of deep learning methods in image fusion. In this work, this survey reports on the development of image fusion algorithms based on deep learning in recent years. Specifically, this paper first conducts a detailed investigation on the fusion method of infrared and visible images based on deep learning, compares the existing fusion algorithms qualitatively and quantitatively with the existing fusion quality indicators, and discusses various fusions. The main contribution, advantages, and disadvantages of the algorithm. Finally, the research status of infrared and visible image fusion is summarized, and future work has prospected. This research can help us realize many image fusion methods in recent years and lay the foundation for future research work. "
The Crosstalk of Epigenetics and Metabolism in Herpesvirus Infection,"Epigenetics is a versatile player in manipulating viral infection and a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of viral-induced diseases. Both epigenetics and metabolism are crucial in establishing a highly specific transcriptional network, which may promote or suppress virus infection. Human herpesvirus infection can induce a broad range of human malignancies and is largely dependent on the status of cellular epigenetics as well as its related metabolism. However, the crosstalk between epigenetics and metabolism during herpesvirus infection has not been fully explored. Here, we describe how epigenetic regulation of cellular metabolism affects herpesvirus infection and induces viral diseases. This further highlights the importance of epigenetics and metabolism during viral infection and provides novel insights into the development of targeted therapies. "
Brewer’s Spent Grains—Valuable Beer Industry By-Product,"The brewing sector is a significant part of the global food industry. Breweries produce large quantities of wastes, including wastewater and brewer’s spent grains. Currently, upcycling of food industry by-products is one of the principles of the circular economy. The aim of this review is to present possible ways to utilize common solid by-product from the brewing sector. Brewer’s spent grains (BSG) is a good material for sorption and processing into activated carbon. Another way to utilize spent grains is to use them as a fuel in raw form, after hydrothermal carbonization or as a feedstock for anaerobic digestion. The mentioned by-products may also be utilized in animal and human nutrition. Moreover, BSG is a waste rich in various substances that may be extracted for further utilization. It is likely that, in upcoming years, brewer’s spent grains will not be considered as a by-product, but as a desirable raw material for various branches of industry. "
Antitumor Activity of Curcumin in Glioblastoma,"Current standard-of-care treatment for glioblastoma, the most common malignant primary central nervous system (CNS) tumor, consists of surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation (Stupp protocol), providing an overall median survival of 15 months. With additional treatment using tumor-treating fields (Optune® therapy, Novocure Ltd., Haifa, Israel), survival can be extended up to 20 months. In spite of significant progress in our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis, the prognosis for patients with malignant gliomas remains poor and additional treatment modalities are critically needed. Curcumin is a bright yellow pigment found in the rhizome of the widely utilized spice, turmeric (Curcuma longa). It has long been used in South Asian traditional medicines and has been demonstrated to have in vitro antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative effects. Curcumin has been demonstrated to induce multiple cytotoxic effects in tumor cells including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, autophagy, changes in gene expression, and disruption of molecular signaling. Additionally, curcumin has been shown to potentiate the effect of radiation on cancer cells, while exhibiting a protective effect on normal tissue. Curcumin’s positive safety profile and widespread availability make it a promising compound for future clinical trials for high-grade gliomas. "
UBAC1/KPC2 Regulates TLR3 Signaling in Human Keratinocytes through Functional Interaction with the CARD14/CARMA2sh-TANK Complex,"CARD14/CARMA2 is a scaffold molecule whose genetic alterations are linked to human inherited inflammatory skin disorders. However, the mechanisms through which CARD14/CARMA2 controls innate immune response and chronic inflammation are not well understood. By means of a yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified the UBA Domain Containing 1 (UBAC1), the non-catalytic subunit of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase KPC complex, as an interactor of CARMA2sh, the CARD14/CARMA2 isoform mainly expressed in human keratinocytes. UBAC1 participates in the CARMA2sh/TANK complex and promotes K63-linked ubiquitination of TANK. In human keratinocytes, UBAC1 negatively regulates the NF-F-activating capacity of CARMA2sh following exposure to poly (I:C), an agonist of Toll-like Receptor 3. Overall, our data indicate that UBAC1 participates in the inflammatory signal transduction pathways involving CARMA2sh. "
Preparation and Study of Sulfonated Co-Polynaphthoyleneimide Proton-Exchange Membrane for a H2/Air Fuel Cell,"The sulfonated polynaphthoyleneimide polymer (co-PNIS70/30) was prepared by copolymerization of 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl ether-2,2'-disulfonic acid (ODAS) and 4,4’-methylenebisanthranilic acid (MDAC) with ODAS/MDAC molar ratio 0.7/0.3. High molecular weight co-PNIS70/30 polymers were synthesized either in phenol or in DMSO by catalytic polyheterocyclization in the presence of benzoic acid and triethylamine. The titration reveals the ion-exchange capacity of the polymer equal to 2.13 meq/g. The membrane films were prepared by casting polymer solution. Conductivities of the polymer films were determined using both in- and through-plane geometries and reached ~96 and ~60 mS/cm, respectively. The anisotropy of the conductivity is ascribed to high hydration of the surface layer compared to the bulk. SFG NMR diffusometry shows that, in the temperature range from 213 to 353 K, the 1H self-diffusion coefficient of the co-PNIS70/30 membrane is about one third of the diffusion coefficient of Nafion® at the same humidity. However, temperature dependences of proton conductivities of Nafion® and of co-PNIS70/30 membranes are nearly identical. Membrane–electrode assemblies (MEAs) based on co-PNIS70/30 were fabricated by different procedures. The optimal MEAs with co-PNIS70/30 membranes are characterized by maximum output power of ~370 mW/cm2 at 80 C. It allows considering sulfonated co-PNIS70/30 polynaphthoyleneimides membrane attractive for practical applications. "
Physicochemical and Biological Characterisation of Diclofenac Oligomeric Poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate) Hybrids as -TCP Ceramics Modifiers for Bone Tissue Regeneration,"Nowadays, regenerative medicine faces a major challenge in providing new, functional materials that will meet the characteristics desired to replenish and grow new tissue. Therefore, this study presents new ceramic-polymer composites in which the matrix consists of tricalcium phosphates covered with blends containing a chemically bounded diclofenac with the biocompatible polymer—poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate), P(3HO). Modification of P(3HO) oligomers was confirmed by NMR, IR and XPS. Moreover, obtained oligomers and their blends were subjected to an in-depth characterisation using GPC, TGA, DSC and AFM. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the hydrophobicity and surface free energy values of blends decreased with the amount of diclofenac modified oligomers. Subsequently, the designed composites were used as a substrate for growth of the pre-osteoblast cell line (MC3T3-E1). An in vitro biocompatibility study showed that the composite with the lowest concentration of the proposed drug is within the range assumed to be non-toxic (viability above 70%). Cell proliferation was visualised using the SEM method, whereas the observation of cell penetration into the scaffold was carried out by confocal microscopy. Thus, it can be an ideal new functional bone tissue substitute, allowing not only the regeneration and restoration of the defect but also inhibiting the development of chronic inflammation.20pt "

Chemical and Laser Ablation Synthesis of Monometallic and Bimetallic Ni-Based Nanoparticles,"The catalytic properties of nanoparticles depend on their size, shape and surface/defect structure, with the entire catalyst performance being governed by the corresponding distributions. Herein, we present two routes of mono- and bimetallic nanoparticle synthesis that enable control of the structural parameters, i.e., wet-chemical synthesis and laser ablation in liquid-phase. The latter is particularly suited to create defect-rich nanoparticles. Impregnation routes were applied to prepare Ni and NiCu nanoparticles, whereas nano- and femtosecond laser ablation in liquid-phase were employed to prepare Ni and NiAu nanoparticles. The effects of the Ni:Cu ratio in impregnation and of laser fluence and liquid-medium on laser ablation are discussed. The atomic structure and (surface) composition of the nanoparticles were characterized by electron microscopic (BF-TEM, DF-TEM, HRTEM) and spectroscopic/diffraction techniques (EDX, SAED, XPS, IR), complemented by theory (DFT). The chemically synthesized bimetallic NiCu nanoparticles initially had Cu-rich surfaces, which changed to Ni-rich upon reaction. For laser ablation, depending on conditions (fluence, type of liquid), highly defective, ordered, or core/shell-like nanoparticles were produced. The case studies highlight the specific benefits of each preparation method for catalyst synthesis and discuss the potential of nanoparticles produced by pulsed laser ablation for catalytic applications.

Is a COVID-19 Vaccine Likely to Make Things Worse?,"In order to limit the disease burden and economic costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to understand how effective and widely distributed a vaccine must be in order to have a beneficial impact on public health. To evaluate the potential effect of a vaccine, we developed risk equations for the daily risk of COVID-19 infection both currently and after a vaccine becomes available. Our risk equations account for the basic transmission probability of COVID-19 () and the lowered risk due to various protection options: physical distancing; face coverings such as masks, goggles, face shields or other medical equipment; handwashing; and vaccination. We found that the outcome depends significantly on the degree of vaccine uptake: if uptake is higher than 80%, then the daily risk can be cut by 50% or more. However, if less than 40% of people get vaccinated and other protection options are abandoned—as may well happen in the wake of a COVID-19 vaccine—then introducing even an excellent vaccine will produce a worse outcome than our current situation. It is thus critical that effective education strategies are employed in tandem with vaccine rollout.  "

Introduction to the Dynamics of Heat Transfer in Buildings,"Changing climatic conditions cause the variability of the parameters of the building’s surroundings, which in turn causes both the gains and losses of heat to change over time. There is variability in both daily and annual cycles. Meeting the requirements of thermal comfort in rooms requires maintaining the required parameters, including constant temperature. Heat gains and losses must be balanced, and this balance is ensured through appropriate heating systems. At the same time, the above means that the demand for heating buildings is not constant but depends on external weather conditions and the energy efficiency of the building. This, in turn, affects the thermal inertia, causing changes in the partition temperature to occur slower than the changes in air temperature. Therefore, the amplitude of the heating power changes is not proportional to the amplitude of the outside air temperature change. The paper presents an example of the analysis of thermal dynamics in buildings. Various aspects of heat transfer in the building were investigated taking into account the transient conditions. The variability of temperature over time at different depths of the partition was analysed, showing the results graphically. The periodic variability of the outside air temperature and the intensity of solar radiation were described by the Fourier series. Moreover, the article shows the influence of the thermal insulation thickness of the external wall on the annual amplitude of temperature changes and on the duration of the heating season, which is important from the point of view of optimization.

A Portable Environmental Data-Monitoring System for Air Hazard Evaluation in Deep Underground Mines,"Air-quality measurements in a deep underground mine are a critical issue. The cost of ventilation, as well as the geometry of the considered mine, make this process very difficult, and local air quality may be a danger to miners. Thus, portable, personal devices are required to inform miners about gas hazards. There are available tools for that purpose; however, they do not allow the storage of data collected during a shift. Moreover, they do not allow the basic analysis of the acquired data cost-effectively. This paper aims to present a system using low-cost gas sensors and microcontrollers, and takes advantage of commonly used smartphones as a computing and visualization resource. Finally, we demonstrate monitoring system results from a test in an underground mine located in Poland. "
Trypanosoma cruzi Modulates PIWI-Interacting RNA Expression in Primary Human Cardiac Myocytes during the Early Phase of Infection,"Trypanosoma cruzi dysregulates the gene expression profile of primary human cardiomyocytes (PHCM) during the early phase of infection through a mechanism which remains to be elucidated. The  role that small non-coding RNAs (sncRNA) including PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) play in regulating gene expression during the early phase of infection is unknown. To  understand how T. cruzi dysregulate gene expression in the heart, we challenged PHCM with T. cruzi trypomastigotes and analyzed sncRNA, especially piRNA, by RNA-sequencing. The  parasite induced significant differential expression of host piRNAs, which  can target and regulate the genes which are important during the early infection phase. An average of 21,595,866 (88.40%) of clean reads mapped to the human reference genome. The  parasite induced 217 unique piRNAs that were significantly differentially expressed (q  0.8). Of these differentially expressed piRNAs, 6 were known and 211 were novel piRNAs. In  silico analysis showed that some of the dysregulated known and novel piRNAs could target and potentially regulate the expression of genes including NFATC2, FOS and TGF-1, reported to play important roles during T. cruzi infection. Further evaluation of the specific functions of the piRNAs in the regulation of gene expression during the early phase of infection will enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanism of T. cruzi pathogenesis. Our  novel findings constitute the first report that T. cruzi can induce differential expression of piRNAs in PHCM, advancing our knowledge about the involvement of piRNAs in an infectious disease model, which  can be exploited for biomarker and therapeutic development.

Linkages among Soil Properties and Litter Quality in Agroforestry Systems of Southeastern Brazil,"Agroforestry systems have been promoted as a solution to address trade-offs between environmental conservation efforts and the need for increased agricultural productivity on smallholder farms in Brazil. However, the impact of land use change from degraded pasture to agroforestry on soil properties remains unclear. The objectives of this research were to: (1) assess soil chemical, physical and biological properties across distinct land uses (degraded pasture, agroforestry and secondary forest); and (2) understand relationships between litter quality, soil organic matter (SOM) and key soil quality parameters in the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest. Soils, macroinvertebrates and litter were collected in April and September of 2018 under five land uses, including: three types of agroforestry systems, a degraded pasture and a secondary forest in Sapucaia, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Our results showed that soil properties clearly separated the three agroforestry systems plots (AS1, AS2, AS3) from the forest and pasture plots. Moreover, litter quality and SOM likely influence multiple biological and physiochemical soil properties under agroforestry systems and secondary forest. Our findings suggest that agroforestry systems can help support soil biological, chemical and physical properties and that the litter quality may be an important driver of their effects and potential contributions to soil restoration in the region.

Polyaspartate-Ionene/Na+-Montmorillonite Nanocomposites as Novel Adsorbent for Anionic Dye; Effect of Ionene Structure,"Surface modification of sodium montmorillonite (Na+-Mt) was performed using antimicrobial agents to produce an ecofriendly nanocomposite. The adsorption performance of the nanocomposite has been evaluated for the removal of Acid Blue 25 dye (AB25) as a model organic pollutant from wastewater. Sodium montmorillonite (Na+-Mt) was modified with three different ionene compounds through ion exchange, and further modified through reaction with polyaspartate to provide three ecofriendly nanocomposites (denoted ICP-1–3). The nanocomposites were characterized using FTIR, PXRD, TEM, SEM, and BET surface area. The adsorption isotherm of AB25 onto ICP-1, ICP-2 and ICP-3 was analyzed using the Langmuir, Freundlich, and Dubinin–Radushkevich (D–R) models. The adsorption isotherm was found to be best fitted by a Freundlich model. The thermodynamic parameters were calculated. The kinetics of the adsorption data were analyzed and the adsorption behavior was found to obey pseudo-second-order kinetics, and the intraparticle diffusion model. The adsorption mechanism was studied by FTIR. "

Biomimetic Amorphous Titania Nanoparticles as Ultrasound Responding Agents to Improve Cavitation and ROS Production for Sonodynamic Therapy,"Conventional therapies to treat cancer often exhibit low specificity, reducing the efficiency of the treatment and promoting strong side effects. To overcome these drawbacks, new ways to fight cancer cells have been developed so far focusing on nanosystems. Different action mechanisms to fight cancer cells have been explored using nanomaterials, being their remote activation one of the most promising. Photo- and sonodynamic therapies are relatively new approaches that emerged following this idea. These therapies are based on the ability of specific agents to generate highly cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) by external stimulation with light or ultrasounds (US), respectively. Crystalline (TiO2) and amorphous titania (a-TiO2) nanoparticles (NPs) present a set of very interesting characteristics, such as their photo-reactivity, photo stability, and effective bactericidal properties. Their production is inexpensive and easily scalable; they are reusable and demonstrated already to be nontoxic. Therefore, these NPs have been increasingly studied as promising photo- or sonosensitizers to be applied in photodynamic/sonodynamic therapies in the future. However, they suffer from poor colloidal stability in aqueous and biological relevant media. Therefore, various organic and polymer-based coatings have been proposed. In this work, the role of a-TiO2 based NPs synthesized through a novel, room-temperature, base-catalyzed, sol-gel protocol in the generation of ROS and as an enhancer of acoustic inertial cavitation was evaluated under ultrasound irradiation. A novel biomimetic coating based on double lipidic bilayer, self-assembled on the a-TiO2-propylamine NPs, is proposed to better stabilize them in water media. The obtained results show that the biomimetic a-TiO2-propylamine NPs are promising candidates to be US responding agents, since an improvement of the cavitation effect occurs in presence of the developed NPs. Further studies will show their efficacy against cancer cells. "
"Ketone- and Cyano-Selenoesters to Overcome Efflux Pump, Quorum-Sensing, and Biofilm-Mediated Resistance","The emergence of drug-resistant pathogens leads to a gradual decline in the efficacy of many antibacterial agents, which poses a serious problem for proper therapy. Multidrug resistance (MDR) mechanisms allow resistant bacteria to have limited uptake of drugs, modification of their target molecules, drug inactivation, or release of the drug into the extracellular space by efflux pumps (EPs). In previous studies, selenoesters have proved to be promising derivatives with a noteworthy antimicrobial activity. On the basis of these results, two series of novel selenoesters were synthesized to achieve more potent antibacterial activity on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Fifteen selenoesters (eight ketone-selenoesters and seven cyano-selenoesters) were investigated with regards to their efflux pump-inhibiting, anti-quorum-sensing (QS), and anti-biofilm effects in vitro. According to the results of the antibacterial activity, the ketone-selenoesters proved to be more potent antibacterial compounds than the cyano-selenoesters. With regard to efflux pump inhibition, one cyano-selenoester on methicillin-resistant S. aureus and one ketone-selenoester on Salmonella Typhimurium were potent inhibitors. The biofilm inhibitory capacity and the ability of the derivatives to disrupt mature biofilms were noteworthy in all the experimental systems applied. Regarding QS inhibition, four ketone-selenoesters and three cyano-selenoesters exerted a noteworthy effect on Vibrio campbellii strains. "
Application of Differential Network Enrichment Analysis for Deciphering Metabolic Alterations,"Modern analytical methods allow for the simultaneous detection of hundreds of metabolites, generating increasingly large and complex data sets. The analysis of metabolomics data is a multi-step process that involves data processing and normalization, followed by statistical analysis. One of the biggest challenges in metabolomics is linking alterations in metabolite levels to specific biological processes that are disrupted, contributing to the development of disease or reflecting the disease state. A common approach to accomplishing this goal involves pathway mapping and enrichment analysis, which assesses the relative importance of predefined metabolic pathways or other biological categories. However, traditional knowledge-based enrichment analysis has limitations when it comes to the analysis of metabolomics and lipidomics data. We present a Java-based, user-friendly bioinformatics tool named Filigree that provides a primarily data-driven alternative to the existing knowledge-based enrichment analysis methods. Filigree is based on our previously published differential network enrichment analysis (DNEA) methodology. To demonstrate the utility of the tool, we applied it to previously published studies analyzing the metabolome in the context of metabolic disorders (type 1 and 2 diabetes) and the maternal and infant lipidome during pregnancy.

Exploring the Mechanism of Gyejibokryeong-hwan against Atherosclerosis Using Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking,"Gyejibokryeong-hwan (GBH) is a traditional formula comprised of five herbal medicines that is frequently used to treat blood stasis and related complex multifactorial disorders such as atherosclerosis. The present study used network pharmacology and molecular docking simulations to clarify the effect and mechanism of the components of GBH. Active compounds were selected using Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System (OASIS) and the Traditional Chinese Medicine System Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP), and target genes linked to the selected components were retrieved using Search Tool for Interacting Chemicals (STITCH) and GeneCards. Functional analysis of potential target genes was performed through the Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) database and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, and molecular docking confirmed the correlation between five core compounds (quercetin, kaempferol, baicalein, ellagic acid, and baicalin) and six potential target genes (AKT1, CASP3, MAPK1, MAPK3, NOS2, and PTGS2). Molecular docking studies indicated that quercetin strongly interacted with six potential target proteins. Thus, these potential target proteins were closely related to TNF, HIF-1, FoxO, and PI3K-Akt signal pathways, suggesting that these factors and pathways may mediate the beneficial effects of GBH on atherosclerosis. Our results identify target genes and pathways that may mediate the clinical effects of the compounds contained within GBH on atherosclerosis. "

Elastic Organic Crystals of -Conjugated Molecules: New Concept for Materials Chemistry,"It is generally believed that organic single crystals composed of a densely packed arrangement of anisotropic, organic small molecules are less useful as functional materials due to their mechanically inflexible and brittle nature, compared to polymers bearing flexible chains and thereby exhibiting viscoelasticity. Nevertheless, organic crystals have attracted much attention because of their tunable optoelectronic properties and a variety of elegant crystal habits and unique ordered or disordered molecular packings arising from the anisotropic molecular structures. However, the recent emergence of flexible organic crystal materials showing plasticity and elasticity has considerably changed the concept of organic single crystals. In this review, the author summarizes the state-of-the-art development of flexible organic crystal materials, especially functional elastic organic crystals which are expected to provide a foothold for the next generation of organic crystal materials.

Testing Seven Hypotheses to Determine What Explains the Current Planthopper (Fulgoridae) Geographical and Species Richness Patterns in China,"Although many hypotheses have been proposed to understand the mechanisms underlying large-scale richness patterns, the environmental determinants are still poorly understood, particularly in insects. Here, we tested the relative contributions of seven hypotheses previously proposed to explain planthopper richness patterns in China. The richness patterns were visualized at a 1  1 grid size, using 14,722 distribution records for 1335 planthoppers. We used ordinary least squares and spatial error simultaneous autoregressive models to examine the relationships between richness and single environmental variables and employed model averaging to assess the environmental variable relative roles. Species richness was unevenly distributed, with high species numbers occurring in the central and southern mountainous areas. The mean annual temperature change since the Last Glacial Maximum was the most important factor for richness patterns, followed by mean annual temperature and net primary productivity. Therefore, historical climate stability, ambient energy, and productivity hypotheses were supported strongly, but orogenic processes and geological isolation may also play a vital role. "
Pathogen-Induced Expression of OsDHODH1 Suggests Positive Regulation of Basal Defense Against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae in Rice,"Bacterial leaf blight (BLB), a vascular disease caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), induces a significant reduction in rice yield in severe epidemics. This study investigated the transcriptional regulation of the OsDHODH1 gene in rice cultivars exposed to the Xoo K3 isolate. The symptoms were monitored on a daily basis, and the lesion length of inoculated rice plants was scored 21 days post inoculation (dpi). The most resistant and the highly susceptible cultivars were used for gene expression analysis. The dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) domain is shared by many proteins in different plant species, and in Arabidopsis, this protein is encoded by the AtPYD1 gene. To investigate the functional role of the OsDHODH1 gene under bacterial infection, we inoculated the Arabidopsis pyd1-2 knockout (atpyd1-2) plants, lacking the AtPYD1 gene (orthologous gene of the rice OsDHODH1), with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000 vir, and the phenotypic response was scored 9 dpi. Results show that OsDHODH1 was upregulated in Tunnae, the most resistant rice cultivar but downregulated in IRAT112, the highly susceptible rice cultivar. In addition, Tunnae, Sipi and NERICA-L14 exhibited a durable resistance phenotype towards Xoo K3 isolate 21 dpi. Moreover, the expression of OsPR1a and OsPR10b (the rice pathogenesis inducible genes) was significantly upregulated in Tunnae, while being suppressed in IRAT112. Furthermore, the atpyd1-2 plants exhibited a high susceptibility towards Pst DC3000 vir. AtPR1 and AtPR2 (the Arabidopsis pathogenesis inducible genes) transcripts decreased in the atpyd1-2 plants compared to Col-0 (wild type) plants. Due to the above, OsDHODH1 and AtPYD1 are suggested to be involved in the basal adaptive response mechanisms towards bacterial pathogen resistance in plants. "
A MBSE Application to Controllers of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles Based on Model-Driven Architecture Concepts,"In this paper, a hybrid realization model is proposed for the controllers of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). This model is based on the model-based systems engineering (MBSE) methodology, in combination with the model-driven architecture (MDA), the real-time unified modeling language (UML)/systems modeling language (SysML), the extended/unscented Kalman filter (EKF/UKF) algorithms, and hybrid automata, and it can be reused for designing controllers of various AUV types. The dynamic model and control structure of AUVs were combined with the specialization of MDA concepts as follows. The computation-independent model (CIM) was specified by the use-case model combined with the EKF/UKF algorithms and hybrid automata to intensively gather the control requirements. Then, the platform-independent model (PIM) was specialized using the real-time UML/SysML to design the capsule collaboration of control and its connections. The detailed PIM was subsequently converted into the platform-specific model (PSM) using open-source platforms to promptly realize the AUV controller. On the basis of the proposed hybrid model, a planar trajectory-tracking controller, which allows a miniature torpedo-shaped AUV to autonomously track the desired planar trajectory, was implemented and evaluated, and shown to have good feasibility.

Activation of the miR-371/372/373 miRNA Cluster Enhances Oncogenicity and Drug Resistance in Oral Carcinoma Cells,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is among the leading causes of cancer-associated deaths worldwide. Family members in miR-371/372/373 miRNA cluster, which is localized at human chromosome 19q13.4, are co-expressed in both human stem cells and malignancies. The individual miRNA in this cluster are also involved in modulating the pathogenesis of malignancies as either oncogenes or suppressors. The 19q13 region is frequently gained in head and neck cancers. High expression of miR-372 and miR-373 are survival predictors for OSCC. However, the role of the miR-371/372/373 cluster in oral carcinogenesis remains to be fully investigated. We use the clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system to establish OSCC cell subclones that had the miR-371/372/373 cluster deleted. In addition, further subclones were established that had the promoter of this cluster deleted. Concordant silencing in SAS cells of miR-371/372/373 decreased oncogenic potential, increased cisplatin sensitivity, activated p53, and upregulated the expression of Bad and DKK1. We also employed the CRISPR/dCas9 synergistic activation mediator system, which allowed robust transcriptional activation of the whole miR-371/372/373 cistron. Upregulation of endogenous miR-371/372/372 expression increased both oncogenicity and drug resistance. These were accompanied by a slight activation of AKT, -catenin, and Src. This study identifies the oncogenic role of the miR-371/372/373 cluster in OSCC. Using CRISPR based strategy can be a powerful paradigm that will provide mechanistic insights into miRNA cluster functionality, which will also likely help the development of targeting options for malignancies.

"Primary Central Nervous System Lymphomas: A Diagnostic Overview of Key Histomorphologic, Immunophenotypic, and Genetic Features","Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare form of extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma that primarily arises in the brain, spinal cord, leptomeninges, and  vitreoretinal compartment of the eye. The term is sometimes used interchangeably with primary central nervous system diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (PCNS DLBCL) because DLBCL comprises a great majority (90–95%) of PCNSL. Although rare, other types of lymphomas can be seen in the central nervous system (CNS), and familiarity with these entities will help their recognition and further workup in order to establish the diagnosis. The latter is especially important in the case of PCNSL where procurement of diagnostic specimen is often challenging and yields scant tissue. In this review, we will discuss the most common types of primary lymphomas that can be seen in the CNS with emphasis on the diagnostic histomorphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular genetic features. The differential diagnostic approach to these cases and potential pitfalls will also be discussed. "
Ensemble Docking Coupled to Linear Interaction Energy Calculations for Identification of Coronavirus Main Protease (3CLpro) Non-Covalent Small-Molecule Inhibitors,"SARS-CoV-2, or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, represents a new strain of Coronaviridae. In the closing 2019 to early 2020 months, the virus caused a global pandemic of COVID-19 disease. We performed a virtual screening study in order to identify potential inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main viral protease (3CLpro or Mpro). For this purpose, we developed a novel approach using ensemble docking high-throughput virtual screening directly coupled with subsequent Linear Interaction Energy (LIE) calculations to maximize the conformational space sampling and to assess the binding affinity of identified inhibitors. A large database of small commercial compounds was prepared, and top-scoring hits were identified with two compounds singled out, namely 1-[(R)-2-(1,3-benzimidazol-2-yl)-1-pyrrolidinyl]-2-(4-methyl-1,4-diazepan-1-yl)-1-ethanone and [({(S)-1-[(1H-indol-2-yl)methyl]-3-pyrrolidinyl}methyl)amino](5-methyl-2H-pyrazol-3-yl)formaldehyde. Moreover, we obtained a favorable binding free energy of the identified compounds, and using contact analysis we confirmed their stable binding modes in the 3CLpro active site. These compounds will facilitate further 3CLpro inhibitor design. "
Changes in Ion Selectivity Following the Asymmetrical Addition of Charge to the Selectivity Filter of Bacterial Sodium Channels,"Voltage-gated sodium channels (NaVs) play fundamental roles in eukaryotes, but their exceptional size hinders their structural resolution. Bacterial NaVs are simplified homologues of their eukaryotic counterparts, but their use as models of eukaryotic Na+ channels is limited by their homotetrameric structure at odds with the asymmetric Selectivity Filter (SF) of eukaryotic NaVs. This work aims at mimicking the SF of eukaryotic NaVs by engineering radial asymmetry into the SF of bacterial channels. This goal was pursued with two approaches: the co-expression of different monomers of the NaChBac bacterial channel to induce the random assembly of heterotetramers, and the concatenation of four bacterial monomers to form a concatemer that can be targeted by site-specific mutagenesis. Patch-clamp measurements and Molecular Dynamics simulations showed that an additional gating charge in the SF leads to a significant increase in Na+ and a modest increase in the Ca2+ conductance in the NavMs concatemer in agreement with the behavior of the population of random heterotetramers with the highest proportion of channels with charge -5e. We thus showed that charge, despite being important, is not the only determinant of conduction and selectivity, and we created new tools extending the use of bacterial channels as models of eukaryotic counterparts.

Lactobacillus Bacteria in Breast Milk,"Breast milk is an optimal food for infants and toddlers. The composition of breast milk adapts to the needs of the developing organism, satisfying nutritional needs at an early stage of growth and development. The results of research to date have shown that breast milk is the best food for a child, containing not only nutrients but also biologically active substances that aid in the optimal, proper growth and development of infants. Among the many components of breast milk, an important element is the probiotic microflora, including bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus spp. These organisms exert a multidirectional, health-promoting effect on the body of children who consume breast milk. The number of lactic acid bacteria, including Lactobacillus, colonizing the breast milk environment and their species diversity varies and depends on many factors, both maternal and environmental. Breast milk, as a recommended food for infants, is an important source of probiotic microflora. The aim of this study was to present the current understanding of probiotic bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus present in breast milk. "

Effect of a Long Exercise Program in the Reduction of Musculoskeletal Discomfort in Office Workers,"The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of a six week exercise program to reduce the muscle tone of the trapezius and musculoskeletal discomfort (MED) of office workers. Twenty-six workers performed an exercise program based on: (1) stretching of cervical and/or dorsal region; (2) joint mobility of shoulders and rachis; (3) strengthening deep stabilizer and core muscles; and (4) scapula stabilizing exercises. A Myoton device was used to evaluate trapezius tone and the Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire was used to assess changes in MED at three points of evaluation: at the beginning (Pre_1) and at the end of the workday (Post_1), and after the training program (Pre_2). The Wilcoxon test and Cohen’s d were performed to examine differences and effect sizes between evaluations. Main results show that trapezius tone remained constant during the workday, but decreased in the dominant upper trapezius (p "
Online Shopping Motives during the COVID-19 Pandemic—Lessons from the Crisis,"The investigation of established drivers of online purchase behavior is of great relevance during the COVID-19 pandemic, as companies must anticipate consumer behavior during this global crisis to maintain a competitive edge. This study investigates online shopping motives of generation Y and Z during the COVID-19 shutdown in April 2020. We use survey data from 451 German consumers to examine the relations between normative, utilitarian and hedonic motives, and purchase intentions employing structural equation modeling. The results show that normative determinants such as media reports on the economic situation are related to consumers’ purchase intentions, whereas the normative influence of close social networks is not. Furthermore, we find that hedonic motivation is a better predictor of purchase intentions than utilitarian motives and that individuals practicing social distancing, generation Z, and women show higher levels of hedonic motivation. We provide recommendations for e-commerce companies on ways to address consumers’ purchase motives and strategically harness normative influences. "
Disposition of Cannabidiol Metabolites in Serum and Urine from Healthy Individuals Treated with Pharmaceutical Preparations of Medical Cannabis,"The use of cannabis flowering tops with standardized amounts of active phytocannabinoids was recently authorized in several countries to treat several painful pathological conditions. The acute pharmacological effects and disposition of -9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), their acidic precursors and THC metabolites after oil and decoction administration have been already described. In this study, the disposition of CBD metabolites: 7-carboxy-cannabidiol (7-COOH-CBD), 7-hydroxycannabidiol (7-OH-CBD), 6–hydroxycannabidiol (6–OH-CBD), and 6–hydroxycannabidiol (6–OH-CBD) in the serum and urine of healthy volunteers was presented. Thirteen healthy volunteers were administered 100 mL of cannabis decoction in the first experimental session and, after 15 days of washout, 0.45 mL of oil. Serum and urine samples were collected at different time points, and the CBD metabolites were quantified by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. The most abundant serum metabolite was 7-COOH-CBD, followed by 7-OH-CBD, 6–OH-CBD, and6–OH-CBD, after decoction and oil. Both 7-OH-CBD and the 6–OH-CBD showed similar pharmacokinetic properties following administration of both cannabis preparations, whereas 7-COOH and 6–OH-CBD displayed a significant higher bioavailability after decoction consumption. All CBD metabolites were similarly excreted after oil and decoction intake apart from 6–OH-CBD, which had a significantly lower excretion after oil administration. The pharmacokinetic characterization of CBD metabolites is crucial for clinical practice since the cannabis herbal preparations are increasingly used for several pathological conditions. "
Automated Sustainable Multi-Object Segmentation and Recognition via Modified Sampling Consensus and Kernel Sliding Perceptron,"Object recognition in depth images is challenging and persistent task in machine vision, robotics, and automation of sustainability. Object recognition tasks are a challenging part of various multimedia technologies for video surveillance, human–computer interaction, robotic navigation, drone targeting, tourist guidance, and medical diagnostics. However, the symmetry that exists in real-world objects plays a significant role in perception and recognition of objects in both humans and machines. With advances in depth sensor technology, numerous researchers have recently proposed RGB-D object recognition techniques. In this paper, we introduce a sustainable object recognition framework that is consistent despite any change in the environment, and can recognize and analyze RGB-D objects in complex indoor scenarios. Firstly, after acquiring a depth image, the point cloud and the depth maps are extracted to obtain the planes. Then, the plane fitting model and the proposed modified maximum likelihood estimation sampling consensus (MMLESAC) are applied as a segmentation process. Then, depth kernel descriptors (DKDES) over segmented objects are computed for single and multiple object scenarios separately. These DKDES are subsequently carried forward to isometric mapping (IsoMap) for feature space reduction. Finally, the reduced feature vector is forwarded to a kernel sliding perceptron (KSP) for the recognition of objects. Three datasets are used to evaluate four different experiments by employing a cross-validation scheme to validate the proposed model. The experimental results over RGB-D object, RGB-D scene, and NYUDv1 datasets demonstrate overall accuracies of 92.2%, 88.5%, and 90.5% respectively. These results outperform existing state-of-the-art methods and verify the suitability of the method. "
Interferon Beta Activity Is Modulated via Binding of Specific S100 Proteins,"Interferon- (IFN-) is a pleiotropic cytokine used for therapy of multiple sclerosis, which is also effective in suppression of viral and bacterial infections and cancer. Recently, we reported a highly specific interaction between IFN- and S100P lowering IFN- cytotoxicity to cancer cells (Int J Biol Macromol. 2020; 143: 633–639). S100P is a member of large family of multifunctional Ca2+-binding proteins with cytokine-like activities. To probe selectivity of IFN—-S100 interaction with respect to S100 proteins, we used surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, chemical crosslinking, and crystal violet assay. Among the thirteen S100 proteins studied S100A1, S100A4, and S100A6 proteins exhibit strictly Ca2+-dependent binding to IFN- with equilibrium dissociation constants, Kd, of 0.04–1.5 M for their Ca2+-bound homodimeric forms. Calcium depletion abolishes the S100—IFN- interactions. Monomerization of S100A1/A4/A6 decreases Kd values down to 0.11–1.0 nM. Interferon- is unable of binding to the S100 proteins studied. S100A1/A4 proteins inhibit IFN–induced suppression of MCF-7 cells viability. The revealed direct influence of specific S100 proteins on IFN- activity uncovers a novel regulatory role of particular S100 proteins, and opens up novel approaches to enhancement of therapeutic efficacy of IFN-.

Adherence to Gluten-Free Diet in Coeliac Paediatric Patients Assessed through a Questionnaire Positively Influences Growth and Quality of Life,"Assessment of adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD) represents the cornerstone in the management of coeliac disease. The primary aim of this study was to assess diet adherence through a questionnaire adapted to children. The secondary aim was to identify influencing factors and outcomes related to diet adherence. In this study, data about diagnosis, education, quality of life (QoL) and anti-transglutaminase (anti-TG2) titers of 160 coeliac children were collected. For the assessment of diet adherence, all participants completed the questionnaire modified from Leffler et al. (2009), while a random sample of 37 also underwent an extensive dietary interview. According to the questionnaire, diet adherence was excellent in 95 (59.4%), fair in 46 (28.8%) and low in 19 (11.9%) patients. Children diagnosed with biopsy showed better adherence than those with a biopsy-sparing approach (p "
Therapeutic Potential of Gnetin C in Prostate Cancer: A Pre-Clinical Study,"Natural stilbenes have gained significant attention in the scientific community owing to their potential anticancer effects against prostate cancer. We recently reported that Gnetin C, a resveratrol (Res) dimer, demonstrated more potent inhibition of metastasis-associated protein 1/v-ets avian erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 2 (MTA1/ETS2) axis in prostate cancer cell lines than other stilbenes. In this study, we investigated in vivo antitumor effects of Gnetin C in two doses (50 and 25 mg/kg, i.p.) using PC3M-Luc subcutaneous xenografts and compared these to Res and pterostilbene (Pter). We found that while vehicle-treated mice revealed rapid tumor progression, compounds-treated mice showed noticeable delay in tumor growth. Gnetin C in 50 mg/kg dose demonstrated the most potent tumor inhibitory effects. Gnetin C in 25 mg/kg dose exhibited tumor inhibitory effects comparable with Pter in 50 mg/kg dose. Consistent with the effective antitumor effects, Gnetin C-treated tumors showed reduced mitotic activity and angiogenesis and a significant increase in apoptosis compared to all the other groups. The data suggest that Gnetin C is more potent in slowing tumor progression in prostate cancer xenografts than Res or Pter. Taken together, we demonstrated, for the first time, that Gnetin C is a lead compound among stilbenes for effectively blocking prostate cancer progression in vivo. "
"New Insights into the Binding Features of F508del CFTR Potentiators: A Molecular Docking, Pharmacophore Mapping and QSAR Analysis Approach","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the autosomal recessive disorder most recurrent in Caucasian populations. To combat this disease, many life-prolonging therapies are required and deeply investigated, including the development of the so-called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators, such as correctors and potentiators. Combination therapy with the two series of drugs led to the approval of several multi-drug effective treatments, such as Orkambi, and to the recent promising evaluation of the triple-combination Elexacaftor-Tezacaftor-Ivacaftor. This  scenario enlightened the effectiveness of the multi-drug approach to pave the way for the discovery of novel therapeutic agents to contrast CF. The recent X-crystallographic data about the human CFTR in complex with the well-known potentiator Ivacaftor (VX-770) opened the possibility to apply a computational study aimed to explore the key features involved in the potentiator binding. Herein, we discussed molecular docking studies performed onto the chemotypes so far discussed in the literature as CFTR potentiator, reporting the most relevant interactions responsible for their mechanism of action, involving Van der Waals interactions and – stacking with F236, Y304, F305 and F312, as well as H-bonding F931, Y304, S308 and R933. This kind of positioning will stabilize the effective potentiator at the CFTR channel. These data have been accompanied by pharmacophore analyses, which promoted the design of novel derivatives endowed with a main (hetero)aromatic core connected to proper substituents, featuring H-bonding moieties. A highly predictive quantitative-structure activity relationship (QSAR) model has been developed, giving a cross-validated r2 (r2cv) "
Lactobacilli Expressing Broadly Neutralizing Nanobodies against HIV-1 as Potential Vectors for HIV-1 Prophylaxis?,"In the absence of an active prophylactic vaccine against HIV-1, passively administered, broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) identified in some chronically infected persons were shown to prevent HIV-1 infection in animal models. However, passive administration of bnAbs may not be suited to prevent sexual HIV-1 transmission in high-risk cohorts, as a continuous high level of active bnAbs may be difficult to achieve at the primary site of sexual transmission, the human vagina with its acidic pH. Therefore, we used Lactobacillus, a natural commensal in the healthy vaginal microbiome, to express bn nanobodies (VHH) against HIV-1 that we reported previously. After demonstrating that recombinant VHHA6 expressed in E. coli was able to protect humanized mice from mucosal infection by HIV-1Bal, we expressed VHHA6 in a soluble or in a cell-wall-anchored form in Lactobacillus rhamnosus DSM14870. This strain is already clinically applied for treatment of bacterial vaginosis. Both forms of VHHA6 neutralized a set of primary epidemiologically relevant HIV-1 strains in vitro. Furthermore, VHHA6 was still active at an acidic pH. Thus, lactobacilli expressing bn VHH potentially represent an attractive vector for the passive immunization of women in cohorts at high risk of HIV-1 transmission. "
Hydrogels and Dentin–Pulp Complex Regeneration: From the Benchtop to Clinical Translation,"Dentin–pulp complex is a term which refers to the dental pulp (DP) surrounded by dentin along its peripheries. Dentin and dental pulp are highly specialized tissues, which can be affected by various insults, primarily by dental caries. Regeneration of the dentin–pulp complex is of paramount importance to regain tooth vitality. The regenerative endodontic procedure (REP) is a relatively current approach, which aims to regenerate the dentin–pulp complex through stimulating the differentiation of resident or transplanted stem/progenitor cells. Hydrogel-based scaffolds are a unique category of three dimensional polymeric networks with high water content. They are hydrophilic, biocompatible, with tunable degradation patterns and mechanical properties, in addition to the ability to be loaded with various bioactive molecules. Furthermore, hydrogels have a considerable degree of flexibility and elasticity, mimicking the cell extracellular matrix (ECM), particularly that of the DP. The current review presents how for dentin–pulp complex regeneration, the application of injectable hydrogels combined with stem/progenitor cells could represent a promising approach. According to the source of the polymeric chain forming the hydrogel, they can be classified into natural, synthetic or hybrid hydrogels, combining natural and synthetic ones. Natural polymers are bioactive, highly biocompatible, and biodegradable by naturally occurring enzymes or via hydrolysis. On the other hand, synthetic polymers offer tunable mechanical properties, thermostability and durability as compared to natural hydrogels. Hybrid hydrogels combine the benefits of synthetic and natural polymers. Hydrogels can be biofunctionalized with cell-binding sequences as arginine–glycine–aspartic acid (RGD), can be used for local delivery of bioactive molecules and cellularized with stem cells for dentin–pulp regeneration. Formulating a hydrogel scaffold material fulfilling the required criteria in regenerative endodontics is still an area of active research, which shows promising potential for replacing conventional endodontic treatments in the near future.

Effect of Oligosaccharide Degree of Polymerization on the Induction of Xylan-Degrading Enzymes by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. Lycopersici,"Xylan is one of the most abundant carbohydrates on Earth. Complete degradation of xylan is achieved by the collaborative action of endo–1,4-xylanases and -d-xylosidases and a number of accessories enzymes. In filamentous fungi, the xylanolytic system is controlled through induction and repression. However, the exact mechanism remains unclear. Substrates containing xylan promote the induction of xylanases, which release xylooligosaccharides. These, in turn, induce expression of xylanase-encoding genes. Here, we aimed to determine which xylan degradation products acted as inducers, and whether the size of the released oligomer correlated with its induction strength. To this end, we compared xylanase production by different inducers, such as sophorose, lactose, cellooligosaccharides, and xylooligosaccharides in Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici. Results indicate that xylooligosaccharides are more effective than other substrates at inducing endoxylanase and -xylosidases. Moreover, we report a correlation between the degree of xylooligosaccharide polymerization and induction efficiency of each enzyme. Specifically, xylotetraose is the best inducer of endoxylanase, xylohexaose of extracellular -xylosidase, and xylobiose of cell-bound -xylosidase. "
Clinical and Electrophysiological Hints to TMS in De Novo Patients with Parkinson’s Disease and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy,"Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can non-invasively probe cortical excitability in movement disorders, although clinical significance is still controversial, especially at early stages. We compare single-pulse TMS in two prototypic synucleinopathy and tauopathy—i.e., Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), respectively—to find neurophysiological differences and identify early measures associated with cognitive impairment. Methods: 28 PD and 23 PSP de novo patients were age-matched with 28 healthy controls, all right-handed and drug-free. Amplitude and latency of motor evoked potentials (MEP), central motor conduction time, resting motor threshold (rMT), and cortical silent period (CSP) were recorded through a figure-of-eight coil from the First Dorsal Interosseous muscle (FDI), bilaterally. Results: Mini Mental Examination and Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) scored worse in PSP; PD had worse FAB than controls. Higher MEP amplitude from right FDI in PD and PSP than controls was found, without difference between them. CSP was bilaterally longer in patients than controls, but similar between patient groups. A positive correlation between FAB and rMT was observed in PSP, bilaterally. Conclusions: Despite the small sample size, PD and PSP might share, at early stage, a similar global electrocortical asset. rMT might detect and possibly predict cognitive deterioration in PSP. "
Risk and Protective Factors of Disordered Eating in Adolescents Based on Gender and Body Mass Index,"The current study aimed to identify potential psychosocial risk and protective factors contributing to eating disorders in adolescents, and observe any differences between genders and Body Mass Index (BMI) categories. A cross-sectional survey was carried out with a total of 2605 (1063 male) adolescents, who were assessed for disordered eating, body-image satisfaction and investment, appearance/weight-related anxiety, situational dysphoria, media influences, self-esteem, and body appreciation. The results revealed that weight/appearance-related anxiety and situational dysphoria were the most significant risk factors for both genders. Pressures from the media posed a significant risk only for males and the internalization of the thin ideal only for females; however, the internalization of the athletic ideal did not pose as a significant risk factor. Compared to gender, these risk factors did not differ based on BMI. Additionally, body appreciation was found to be a robust protective factor (unlike global self-esteem) for both genders, and across all BMI groups. The findings indicate that the most significant risk and protective factors of eating disorders do not differ largely for male and female adolescents or different BMIs. Intervention and prevention programs would therefore benefit from the inclusion of exercises that reduce the constructs of weight/appearance-related anxiety and situational dysphoria, and promote body appreciation. "
Gender Phenotyping of Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome Using a Network Science Approach,"We defined gender-specific phenotypes for men and women diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) based on easy-to-measure anthropometric parameters, using a network science approach. We collected data from 2796 consecutive patients since 2005, from 4 sleep laboratories in Western Romania, recording sleep, breathing, and anthropometric measurements. For both genders, we created specific apnea patient networks defined by patient compatibility relationships in terms of age, body mass index (BMI), neck circumference (NC), blood pressure (BP), and Epworth sleepiness score (ESS). We classified the patients with clustering algorithms, then statistically analyzed the groups/clusters. Our study uncovered eight phenotypes for each gender. We found that all males with OSAS have a large NC, followed by daytime sleepiness and high BP or obesity. Furthermore, all unique female phenotypes have high BP, followed by obesity and sleepiness. We uncovered gender-related differences in terms of associated OSAS parameters. In males, we defined the pattern large NC–sleepiness–high BP as an OSAS predictor, while in women, we found the pattern of high BP–obesity–sleepiness. These insights are useful for increasing awareness, improving diagnosis, and treatment response. "
Mesoporous Carbon of Carbonized Human Urine Waste: A Valuable Heterogeneous Catalyst for Chromene and Xanthene Derivative Synthesis,"Human urine is universal unused waste material that is regularly disposed of by the human body. We, for the first time, presented an economically beneficial, sustainable, and novel route to synthesize mesoporous human urine carbon (HUC)-containing heteroatoms, i.e., C, Na, Cl, N, S, and P, using a human urine waste. The as-synthesized HUC were envisaged for their structural elucidation, morphology evolution, crystal structure, functional bonding, and elemental composition analyses through various sophisticated technologies. The HUC catalyst had a moderately crystalline nature due to the graphitic phase of carbon with a particle size of 20–50 nm, which was successfully used to synthesizing chromenes, 1,8-di-oxo-octahydroxanthenes, and benzypyrazolylcoumarin and biscoumarin derivatives through a one-pot multicomponent reaction with 20 mg of catalyst in EtOH/H2O solvent. This eco-friendly and simple method offers numerous advantages such as easy purification, clean reaction, and excellent yield for organic synthesis. The HUC catalyst can be recycled ten times and reused multiple times after activation without affecting catalytic performance. "
Putative Role of Protein Palmitoylation in Cardiac Lipid-Induced Insulin Resistance,"In the heart, inhibition of the insulin cascade following lipid overload is strongly associated with contractile dysfunction. The translocation of fatty acid transporter CD36 (SR-B2) from intracellular stores to the cell surface is a hallmark event in the lipid-overloaded heart, feeding forward to intracellular lipid accumulation. Yet, the molecular mechanisms by which intracellularly arrived lipids induce insulin resistance is ill-understood. Bioactive lipid metabolites (diacyl-glycerols, ceramides) are contributing factors but fail to correlate with the degree of cardiac insulin resistance in diabetic humans. This leaves room for other lipid-induced mechanisms involved in lipid-induced insulin resistance, including protein palmitoylation. Protein palmitoylation encompasses the reversible covalent attachment of palmitate moieties to cysteine residues and is governed by protein acyl-transferases and thioesterases. The function of palmitoylation is to provide proteins with proper spatiotemporal localization, thereby securing the correct unwinding of signaling pathways. In this review, we provide examples of palmitoylations of individual signaling proteins to discuss the emerging role of protein palmitoylation as a modulator of the insulin signaling cascade. Second, we speculate how protein hyper-palmitoylations (including that of CD36), as they occur during lipid oversupply, may lead to insulin resistance. Finally, we conclude that the protein palmitoylation machinery may offer novel targets to fight lipid-induced cardiomyopathy. "
"Mortality Prediction of the CHA2DS2-VASc Score, the HAS-BLED Score, and Their Combination in Anticoagulated Patients with Atrial Fibrillation","Background and Objectives: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with increased mortality, predictors of which are poorly characterized. We investigated the predictive power of the commonly used CHA2DS2-VASc score (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age  75 years [doubled], diabetes, stroke/transient ischemic attack/thromboembolism [doubled], vascular disease [prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque], age 65–75 years, sex category [female]), the HAS-BLED score (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio [INR], elderly [age  65 years], drugs/alcohol concomitantly), and their combination for mortality in AF patients. Methods: The PREvention oF thromboembolic events—European Registry in Atrial Fibrillation (PREFER in AF) was a prospective registry including AF patients across seven European countries. We used logistic regression to analyze the relationship between the CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores and outcomes, including mortality, at one year. We evaluated the performance of logistic regression models by discrimination measures (C-index and DeLong test) and calibration measures (Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), with bootstrap techniques for internal validation. Results: In 5209 AF patients with complete information on both scores, average one-year mortality was 3.1%. We found strong gradients between stroke/systemic embolic events (SSE), major bleeding and—specifically—mortality for both CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores, with a similar C-statistic for event prediction. The predictive power of the models with both scores combined, removing overlapping components, was significantly enhanced (p < 0.01) compared to models including either CHA2DS2-VASc or HAS-BLED alone: for mortality, C-statistic: 0.740, compared to 0.707 for CHA2DS2-VASc or 0.646 for HAS-BLED alone. IDI analyses supported the significant improvement for the combined score model compared to separate score models for all outcomes. Conclusions: Both the CHA2DS2-VASc and the HAS-BLED scores predict mortality similarly in patients with AF, and a combination of their components increases prediction significantly. Such combination may be useful for investigational and—possibly—also clinical purposes. "
Comparison of Various Obesity-Related Indices for Identification of Metabolic Syndrome: A Population-Based Study from Taiwan Biobank,"This study aimed to evaluate the performance of 11 obesity-related indices, including body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio, waist–hip ratio, a body shape index, abdominal volume index, body adiposity index, body roundness index, conicity index, visceral adiposity index (VAI), and triglyceride glucose (TyG) index, in identifying metabolic syndrome (MetS) in adults. The information of 5000 participants was obtained from the Taiwan Biobank. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the associations between MetS and obesity-related indices with odds ratio (ORs). The predictive performance of the indices to identify MetS was compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and areas under curves (AUCs). Multivariate-adjusted logistic regression showed that the ORs for MetS increased across the quartiles of each index. ROC curves analysis demonstrated that TyG index had the greatest AUC in men (AUC "
"Social Media Activities, Emotion Regulation Strategies, and Their Interactions on People’s Mental Health in COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed the general population’s life worldwide. People may spend more time on social media because of policies like “work at home”. Using a cross-sectional dataset collected through an online survey in February 2020, in China, we examined (1) the relationships between social media activities and people’s mental health status and (2) the moderation effect of emotional-regulation strategies. The sample included people aged 18 years from 32 provinces and regions in China (N "
Carbohydrate and Glutamine Supplementation Attenuates the Increase in Rating of Perceived Exertion during Intense Exercise in Hypoxia Similar to 4200 m,"The rating of perceived exertion (RPE) indicates the feeling of fatigue. However, hypoxia worsens the condition and can worsen RPE. We evaluated whether carbohydrate and glutamine supplementation alters RPE and physiological markers in running at 70% peak oxygen uptake until exhaustion in a simulated altitude of 4500 m. Nine volunteers underwent three running tests at 70% peak oxygen uptake until exhaustion: (1) hypoxia and placebo, (2) hypoxia and 8% maltodextrin, and (3) hypoxia after six days of glutamine supplementation (20 g/day) and 8% maltodextrin. The exercise and supplementation were randomized and double-blinded. Lactate, heart rate, haemoglobin O2 saturation (SpO2%), and RPE (6–20 scale) were analyzed at the 15th and 30th min. The level of significance was set at p  0.05. SpO2% decreased at the 15th and 30th minutes compared to resting in placebo, carbohydrate, and glutamine supplementation. RPE increased at the 30th minute compared to the 15th minute in placebo and carbohydrate supplementation; however, there was no difference in the glutamine supplementation condition. Heart rate and lactate increased after the 15th and 30th minutes compared to resting, similar to the three conditions studied. We conclude that previous supplementation with glutamine and carbohydrate during intense exercise in hypoxia similar to 4500 m can attenuate the increase in RPE by the increase in glycemia and can be a useful strategy for people who exercise in these conditions.

Trimethyllysine: From Carnitine Biosynthesis to Epigenetics,"Trimethyllysine is an important post-translationally modified amino acid with functions in the carnitine biosynthesis and regulation of key epigenetic processes. Protein lysine methyltransferases and demethylases dynamically control protein lysine methylation, with each state of methylation changing the biophysical properties of lysine and the subsequent effect on protein function, in particular histone proteins and their central role in epigenetics. Epigenetic reader domain proteins can distinguish between different lysine methylation states and initiate downstream cellular processes upon recognition. Dysregulation of protein methylation is linked to various diseases, including cancer, inflammation, and genetic disorders. In this review, we cover biomolecular studies on the role of trimethyllysine in carnitine biosynthesis, different enzymatic reactions involved in the synthesis and removal of trimethyllysine, trimethyllysine recognition by reader proteins, and the role of trimethyllysine on the nucleosome assembly.

Implications of Network Diversity for Venture Growth: The Mediation Effect of Entrepreneurial Alertness,"This paper extends the conventional wisdom of social networks and entrepreneurship by clarifying the relationship between network diversity and venture growth as well as by studying the mediation effect of entrepreneurial alertness on network diversity. It highlights the importance of diverse networks for providing heterogeneous information and resources, which is the antecedent of entrepreneurial alertness. In this paper, Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) data from 44 countries are used in our analysis, considering the country’s impact. Overall, we concluded that network diversity can significantly predict entrepreneurial alertness, and a venture’s growth. Furthermore, an entrepreneur’s educational level and entrepreneurial experience have positive moderating effects on the relationship between network diversity and entrepreneurial alertness. "
Sensing of Proteins by ICD Response of Iron(II) Clathrochelates Functionalized by Carboxyalkylsulfide Groups,"Recognition of elements of protein tertiary structure is crucial for biotechnological and biomedical tasks; this makes the development of optical sensors for certain protein surface elements important. Herein, we demonstrated the ability of iron(II) clathrochelates (1–3) functionalized with mono-, di- and hexa-carboxyalkylsulfide to induce selective circular dichroism (CD) response upon binding to globular proteins. Thus, inherently CD-silent clathrochelates revealed selective inducing of CD spectra when binding to human serum albumin (HSA) (1, 2), beta-lactoglobuline (2) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) (3). Hence, functionalization of iron(II) clathrochelates with the carboxyalkylsulfide group appears to be a promising tool for the design of CD-probes sensitive to certain surface elements of proteins tertiary structure. Additionally, interaction of 1–3 with proteins was also studied by isothermal titration calorimetry, protein fluorescence quenching, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and computer simulations. Formation of both 1:1 and 1:2 assemblies of HSA with 1–3 was evidenced by ESI-MS. A protein fluorescence quenching study suggests that 3 binds with both BSA and HSA via the sites close to Trp residues. Molecular docking calculations indicate that for both BSA and HSA, binding of 3 to Site I and to an “additional site” is more favorable energetically than binding to Site II. "
HLA-DRB1*07:01 and *08:02 Alleles Confer a Protective Effect Against ACPA-Positive Rheumatoid Arthritis in a Latin American Admixed Population,"HLA-DRB1 shared epitope (SE) alleles are important genetic contributors for the risk of developing anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA)-positive rheumatoid arthritis (RA), particularly in Caucasians. We aimed to analyze the contribution of HLA-DRB1 alleles and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region to the susceptibility to develop ACPA-positive RA in a Latin American (LA) population with admixed ancestry. A total of 289 ACPA-positive RA patients and 510 controls were enrolled in this study. The presence of HLA-DRB1*04:01, *09:01 and *10:01 was increased in ACPA-positive RA patients compared with healthy controls (p < 0.0001, p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively), whereas DRB1*07:01 and *08:02 was associated with a decreased risk of ACPA-positive RA (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively). These results showed a strong correlation with estimates from studies in Asians but not in Caucasian populations. The present study describes the protective effects of the HLA-DRB1*07:01 and *08:02 alleles in ACPA-positive RA patients in a LA population for the first time. Identifying relationships between HLA-DRB1 alleles and RA is important for identifying disease associations in different ethnic groups in order to reach a better understanding of RA worldwide. "
Single Cell Detection of the p53 Protein by Mass Cytometry,"Purpose: The p53 protein and its post-translational modifications are distinctly expressed in various normal cell types and malignant cells and are usually detected by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry in contemporary diagnostics. Here, we describe an approach for simultaneous multiparameter detection of p53, its post-translational modifications and p53 pathway-related signaling proteins in single cells using mass cytometry. Method: We conjugated p53-specific antibodies to metal tags for detection by mass cytometry, allowing the detection of proteins and their post-translational modifications in single cells. We provide an overview of the antibody validation process using relevant biological controls, including cell lines treated in vitro with a stimulus (irradiation) known to induce changes in the expression level of p53. Finally, we present the potential of the method through investigation of primary samples from leukemia patients with distinct TP53 mutational status. Results: The p53 protein can be detected in cell lines and in primary samples by mass cytometry. By combining antibodies for p53-related signaling proteins with a surface marker panel, we show that mass cytometry can be used to decipher the single cell p53 signaling pathway in heterogeneous patient samples. Conclusion: Single cell profiling by mass cytometry allows the investigation of the p53 functionality through examination of relevant downstream signaling proteins in normal and malignant cells. Our work illustrates a novel approach for single cell profiling of p53. "
"Nightmares in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, and Psychotic Disorders: A Systematic Review","Chronic nightmares are very common in psychiatric disorders, affecting up to 70% of patients with personality or post-traumatic stress disorders. In other psychiatric disorders, the relationships with nightmares are poorly known. This review aimed to clarify the relationship between nightmares and both mood and psychotic disorders. We performed a systematic literature search using the PubMed, Cochrane Library and PsycINFO databases until December 2019, to identify studies of patients suffering from either a mood disorder or a psychotic disorder associated with nightmares. From the 1145 articles screened, 24 were retained, including 9 studies with patients with mood disorders, 11 studies with patients with psychotic disorders and 4 studies with either psychotic or mood disorders. Nightmares were more frequent in individuals with mood or psychotic disorders than in healthy controls (more than two-fold). Patients with frequent nightmares had higher suicidality scores and had more frequently a history of suicide attempt. The distress associated with nightmares, rather than the frequency of nightmares, was associated with the severity of the psychiatric disorder. Further studies assessing whether nightmare treatment not only improves patient–sleep perception but also improves underlying psychiatric diseases are needed. In conclusion, nightmares are overrepresented in mood and psychotic disorders, with the frequency associated with suicidal behaviors and the distress associated with the psychiatric disorder severity. These findings emphasize major clinical and therapeutic implications. "
Hardware-Based Hopfield Neuromorphic Computing for Fall Detection," With the popularity of smart wearable systems, sensor signal processing poses more challenges to machine learning in embedded scenarios. For example, traditional machine-learning methods for data classification, especially in real time, are computationally intensive. The deployment of Artificial Intelligence algorithms on embedded hardware for fast data classification and accurate fall detection poses a huge challenge in achieving power-efficient embedded systems. Therefore, by exploiting the associative memory feature of Hopfield Neural Network, a hardware module has been designed to simulate the Neural Network algorithm which uses sensor data integration and data classification for recognizing the fall. By adopting the Hebbian learning method for training neural networks, weights of human activity features are obtained and implemented/embedded into the hardware design. Here, the neural network weight of fall activity is achieved through data preprocessing, and then the weight is mapped to the amplification factor setting in the hardware. The designs are checked with validation scenarios, and the experiment is completed with a Hopfield neural network in the analog module. Through simulations, the classification accuracy of the fall data reached 88.9% which compares well with some other results achieved by the software-based machine-learning algorithms, which verify the feasibility of our hardware design. The designed system performs the complex signal calculations of the hardware's feedback signal, replacing the software-based method. A straightforward circuit design is used to meet the weight setting from the Hopfield neural network, which is maximizing the reusability and flexibility of the circuit design.  "
Systematic Study of the Influence of the Angle of Incidence Discretization in Reflectarray Analysis to Improve Support Vector Regression Surrogate Models,"A systematic study concerning the discretization of the angle of incidence in surrogate models obtained with support vector regression (SVR) is presented. The problem addressed in this work arises from the dependence of the reflection coefficients on the angle of incidence. While the direct coefficients are usually stable with the angle of incidence, this is not the case with the cross-coefficients, which translates this behavior to the crosspolar component of the radiation pattern. Then, correctly assessing this influence and minimizing radiation pattern distortion allow training SVR surrogate models per angle of incidence without penalizing accuracy in the prediction of the far field. The results shown in this work are directly relevant to improving the computational performance of SVRs applied to reflectarray design since they allow reducing the dimensionality of the models by generating surrogate models per angle of incidence instead of including the angles of incidence as input variables. In addition, it highlights the importance of a proper discretization of the angles of incidence for a correct prediction of the crosspolar pattern for its subsequent optimization, especially for advanced space applications with tight crosspolar requirements.

CATACLYSMIC VARIABLES OBSERVED DURING K2 CAMPAIGNS 0 AND 1,"The Astronomical Journal, 152(2016) 5. doi:10.3847/0004-6256/152/1/5 "
Sensitive Analysis of Idarubicin in Human Urine and Plasma by Liquid Chromatography with Fluorescence Detection: An Application in Drug Monitoring,"A new approach for the sensitive, robust and rapid determination of idarubicin (IDA) in human plasma and urine samples based on liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (LC-FL) was developed. Satisfactory chromatographic separation of the analyte after solid-phase extraction (SPE) was performed on a Discovery HS C18 analytical column using a mixture of acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water as the mobile phase in isocratic mode. IDA and daunorubicin hydrochloride used as an internal standard (I.S.) were monitored at the excitation and emission wavelengths of 487 and 547 nm, respectively. The method was validated according to the FDA and ICH guidelines. The linearity was confirmed in the range of 0.1–50 ng/mL and 0.25–200 ng/mL, while the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.05 and 0.125 ng/mL in plasma and urine samples, respectively. The developed LC-FL method was successfully applied for drug determinations in human plasma and urine after oral administration of IDA at a dose of 10 mg to a patient with highly advanced alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (RMA). Moreover, the potential exposure to IDA present in both fluids for healthcare workers and the caregivers of patients has been evaluated. The present LC-FL method can be a useful tool in pharmacokinetic and clinical investigations, in the monitoring of chemotherapy containing IDA, as well as for sensitive and reliable IDA quantitation in biological fluids.

Hydrophobic Fluorinated Porous Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Adsorption of Nerve Agents,"Humidity in the air can significantly limit the adsorption capacity of porous materials used for the removal of chemical warfare agents (CWAs). Therefore, in this work, we prepared a porous organic material (C-1) and its fluoride derivative (C-1-F) via a Schiff base reaction and determined their structure and morphological properties, hydrophobicity, and adsorption capacity. Compared to the parent C-1 material, both the channel and particle surface of C-1-F were highly hydrophobic, thus stabilizing the fluorinated porous material under various humidity conditions. Dimethyl methyl phosphonate was used as a nerve agent simulant to examine the efficiency of the synthesized porous materials, indicating that C-1-F had a higher adsorption capacity than C-1 under dry conditions. Moreover, unlike C-1, the adsorption capacity of hydrophobic C-1-F was not affected even under a relative humidity of 20%, and it is still able to maintain high adsorption capacity at a relative humidity of 60%, suggesting its high application potential in the removal of CWAs.

Perfect Impedance Matching with Meta-Surfaces Made of Ultra-Thin Metal Films: A Phenomenological Approach to the Ideal THz Sensors,"The terahertz (THz) frequency range is incredibly important as it covers electromagnetic emissions typical for biological and molecular processes. All molecules emit THz waves in a unique fingerprint pattern, although the intensity of such signals is usually too weak to be detected. To address the efficiency gap in existing THz devices it is extremely important to create surfaces with perfect anti-reflection properties. Although metals are absolutely reflective, here we show both theoretically and experimentally that by constructing meta-surfaces made of a superposition of ultra-thin metallic nano-films (a couple of nanometres thick) and oxide layers a unique property of perfect transmission and impedance matching may be realised. The perfect transmission rates can be as high as 100% and it may be achieved in both optical and THz regimes. The predicted effect has been observed for numerous meta-surfaces of different compositions. The effect found here is expected to impact the renewable energies sectors, optoelectronic and telecommunication industries, accelerating the arrival of the sensors for the new 6G-technology. The phenomenon is highly relevant to all scientific fields where minimising electromagnetic losses through reflection is important. "
"Epigenetic Regulation of the Hippocampus, with Special Reference to Radiation Exposure","The hippocampus is crucial in learning, memory and emotion processing, and is involved in the development of different neurological and neuropsychological disorders. Several epigenetic factors, including DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs, have been shown to regulate the development and function of the hippocampus, and the alteration of epigenetic regulation may play important roles in the development of neurocognitive and neurodegenerative diseases. This review summarizes the epigenetic modifications of various cell types and processes within the hippocampus and their resulting effects on cognition, memory and overall hippocampal function. In addition, the effects of exposure to radiation that may induce a myriad of epigenetic changes in the hippocampus are reviewed. By assessing and evaluating the current literature, we hope to prompt a more thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie radiation-induced epigenetic changes, an area which can be further explored.

High-Yielding Lovastatin Producer Aspergillus terreus Shows Increased Resistance to Inhibitors of Polyamine Biosynthesis,"The biosynthesis of pharmaceutically significant secondary metabolites in filamentous fungi is a multistep process that depends on a wide range of various factors, one of which is the intracellular content of polyamines. We have previously shown that in Aspergillus terreus lovastatin high-yielding strain (HY) exogenous introduction of polyamines during fermentation can lead to an increase in the production of lovastatin by 20–45%. However, the molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon have not been elucidated. In this regard, we carried out an inhibitory analysis at the key stage of polyamine biosynthesis, the conversion of L-ornithine to putrescine by the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). A. terreus HY strain showed upregulation of genes for biosynthesis of polyamines, 3–10-fold, and increased resistance compared to the original wild-type strain upon inhibition of ODC on synthetic medium with 5 mM -difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), by 20–25%, and 5 mM 1-aminooxy-3-aminopropane (APA), by 40–45%. The data obtained indicate changes in the metabolism of polyamines in A. terreus HY strain. The observed phenomenon may have a universal character among fungal producers of secondary metabolites improved by classical methods, since previously the increased resistance to ODC inhibitors was also shown for Acremonium chrysogenum, a high-yielding producer of cephalosporin C.

RTRO–Coal: Real-Time Resource-Reconciliation and Optimization for Exploitation of Coal Deposits,"This contribution presents an innovative and integrated framework for real-time-process reconciliation and optimization (RTRO) in large continuous open pit coal mines. RTRO-Coal is currently developed, validated, tested and implemented as part of a multi-national multi-partner European Union funded R&D project. The key concept is to promote a shift in paradigm from intermittent discontinuous to a continuous process monitoring and quality management system in large scale coal mining operations. The framework is based on a real-time feedback control loop linking online data acquired during extraction rapidly with a sequentially up-datable resource model. The up-to-date model is integrated with a real-time optimization of short-term sequencing and production control decisions. Improved decisions are expected to lead to increased resource-and process efficiency and support a sustainable extraction of natural resources. This contribution introduces to the framework, discusses main building blocks and illustrates the value added by the means of selected examples. "
Picomolar SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Using Multi-Arm PEG Nanobody Constructs,"Multivalent antibody constructs have a broad range of clinical and biotechnological applications. Nanobodies are especially useful as components for multivalent constructs as they allow increased valency while maintaining a small molecule size. We here describe a novel, rapid method for the generation of bi- and multivalent nanobody constructs with oriented assembly by Cu-free strain promoted azide-alkyne click chemistry (SPAAC). We used sortase A for ligation of click chemistry functional groups site-specifically to the C-terminus of nanobodies before creating C-to-C-terminal nanobody fusions and 4-arm polyethylene glycol (PEG) tetrameric nanobody constructs. We demonstrated the viability of this approach by generating constructs with the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing nanobody Ty1. We compared the ability of the different constructs to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus and infectious virus in neutralization assays. The generated dimers neutralized the virus similarly to a nanobody-Fc fusion variant, while a 4-arm PEG based tetrameric Ty1 construct dramatically enhanced neutralization of SARS-CoV-2, with an IC50 in the low picomolar range. "
IgA2 Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Correlate with NET Formation and Fatal Outcome in Severely Diseased COVID-19 Patients,"Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) leads to an adaptive immune response in the host and the formation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. While IgG responses against SARS-CoV-2 have been characterized quite well, less is known about IgA. IgA2 activates immune cells and induces inflammation and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation which may contribute to organ injury and fatal outcome in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein specific antibody levels were measured in plasma samples of 15 noninfected controls and 82 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with no or mild symptoms, moderate symptoms (hospitalization) or severe disease (intensive care unit, ICU). Antibody levels were compared to levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and circulating extracellular DNA (ecDNA) as markers for general inflammation and NET formation, respectively. While levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG were similar in all patient groups, IgA2 antibodies were restricted to severe disease and showed the strongest discrimination between nonfatal and fatal outcome in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. While anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA2 levels correlated with CRP levels in severely diseased patients, only anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA2 correlated with ecDNA. These data suggest that the formation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA2 during SARS-CoV-2 infection is a marker for more severe disease related to NET formation and poor outcome. "
Silicon-Based Anode of Lithium Ion Battery Made of Nano Silicon Flakes Partially Encapsulated by Silicon Dioxide,"Ubiquitous mobile electronic devices and rapidly increasing electric vehicles demand a better lithium ion battery (LIB) with a more durable and higher specific charge storage capacity than traditional graphite-based ones. Silicon is among the most promising active media since it exhibits ten times of a specific capacity. However, alloying with lithium by silicon and dissociation of the silicon-lithium alloys induce high volume changes and result in pulverization. The loss of electrical contacts by silicon with the current collector of the anode causes rapid capacity decay. We report improved anode cycling performance made of silicon flakes partially encapsulated by silicon dioxide and coated with conductive nanocarbon films and CNTs. The silicon dioxide surface layer on a silicon flake improves the physical integrity for a silicon-based anode. The exposed silicon surface provides a fast transport of lithium ions and electrons. CNTs and nanocarbon films provide electrical connections between silicon flakes and the current collector. We report a novel way of manufacturing silicon flakes partially covered by silicon dioxide through breaking oxidized silicon flakes into smaller pieces. Additionally, we demonstrate an improved cycling life and capacity retention compared to pristine silicon flakes and silicon flakes fully encapsulated by silicon dioxide. Nanocarbon coatings provide conduction channels and further improve the anode performance. "
"Porcine Circovirus 2 Genotypes, Immunity and Vaccines: Multiple Genotypes but One Single Serotype","Identified for the first time in the 1990s, Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2) should not be considered an emerging virus anymore. Nevertheless, many aspects of its biology and epidemiology are still controversial. Particularly, its high evolutionary rate has caused the emergence of several variants and genotypes, alternating on the worldwide proscenium. The biological and practical implications of such heterogenicity are unfortunately largely unknown. The effectiveness of currently available vaccines against new genotypes that have emerged over time has been the topic of an intense debate and often inconclusive or contradictory results between experimental, field, and epidemiological studies have been gathered. The challenge in establishing an effective PCV-2 disease model, the peculiarities in experimental design and settings and the strains involved could justify the observed differences. The present work aims to summarize and critically review the available knowledge on PCV-2 genetic heterogeneity, immunity, and vaccine efficacy, organizing and harmonizing the available data from different sources, shedding light on this complex field and highlighting current knowledge gaps and future perspectives. So far, all vaccines in the market have shown great efficacy in reducing clinical signs associated to diseases caused by PCV-2, independently of the genotype present in the farm. Moreover, experimental data demonstrated the cross-protection of PCV-2a vaccines against the most widespread genotypes (PCV-2a, PCV-2b, and PCV-2d). Therefore, despite the significant number of genotypes described/proposed (PCV-2a to PCV-2i), it seems one single PCV-2 serotype would exist so far. "
On the Continuous Cancellative Semigroups on a Real Interval and on a Circle and Some Symmetry Issues,"Let S denote the unit circle on the complex plane and :S2S be a continuous binary, associative and cancellative operation. From some already known results, it can be deduced that the semigroup (S,) is isomorphic to the group (S,); thus, it is a group, where  is the usual multiplication of complex numbers. However, an elementary construction of such isomorphism has not been published so far. We present an elementary construction of all such continuous isomorphisms F from (S,) into (S,) and obtain, in this way, the following description of operation : xy"
"Oncolytic Adenovirus CD55-Smad4 Suppresses Cell Proliferation, Metastasis, and Tumor Stemness in Colorectal Cancer by Regulating Wnt/-Catenin Signaling Pathway","During the past few decades, colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality have significantly increased, and CRC has become the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Thus, exploring novel effective therapies for CRC is imperative. In this study, we investigated the effect of oncolytic adenovirus CD55-Smad4 on CRC cell growth. Cell viability assay, animal experiments, flow cytometric analysis, cell migration, and invasion assays, and Western blotting were used to detect the proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion of CRC cells. The oncolytic adenovirus CD55-Smad4 was successfully constructed and effectively suppressed CRC cell proliferation in vivo and in vitro. Notably, CD55-Smad4 activated the caspase signaling pathway, inducing the apoptosis of CRC cells. Additionally, the generated oncolytic adenovirus significantly suppressed migration and invasion of CRC cells by overexpressing Smad4 and inhibiting Wnt/-catenin/epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signaling pathway. Moreover, CRC cells treated with CD55-Smad4 formed less and smaller spheroid colonies in serum-free culture than cells in control groups, suggesting that CD55-Smad4 suppressed the stemness of CRC cells by inhibiting the Wnt/-catenin pathway. Together, the results of this study provide valuable information for the development of a novel strategy for cancer-targeting gene-virotherapy and provide a deeper understanding of the critical significance of Smad4 in gene therapy of CRC.

The Design of Near-Perfect Spectrum-Selective Mirror Based on Photonic Structures for Passive Cooling of Silicon Solar Cells,"When exposed to sunlight, crystalline silicon solar cells (CSSC) will not only generate electric energy but are also heated by solar radiation. Such a self-heating effect makes the working temperature of CSSC 20–40 C higher than that of the ambient temperature, which degrades their efficiency and reliability. The elevated operating temperatures of CSSC are mainly derived from absorbing photons that cannot be converted to electrons. Therefore, it is important to prevent CSSC from absorbing useless solar light to have a better cooling effect. In this paper, photonic structures based spectrum-selective mirror is designed to cool the operating temperatures of CSSC passively. The mirror could make CSSC absorb about 93% of the sunlight in the wavelength range of 0.3 to 1.1 m and only absorb about 4% of the sunlight in the wavelength range of 1.1 to 2.5 m. Meanwhile, the design has good compatibility with the radiative cooling strategy. By applying selective-absorptive and radiative cooling strategies, the operating temperature of CSSC could be decreased about 23.2 K and 68.1 K under different meteorological conditions. Moreover, unlike the single radiative cooling strategy, the spectrum-selective mirror also has effective cooling effects in high wind speed meteorological conditions. "
Innovation and Application of the Type III Secretion System Inhibitors in Plant Pathogenic Bacteria,"Many Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria rely on a functional type III secretion system (T3SS), which injects multiple effector proteins into eukaryotic host cells, for their pathogenicity. Genetic studies conducted in different host-microbe pathosystems often revealed a sophisticated regulatory mechanism of their T3SSs, suggesting that the expression of T3SS is tightly controlled and constantly monitored by bacteria in response to the ever-changing host environment. Therefore, it is critical to understand the regulation of T3SS in pathogenic bacteria for successful disease management. This review focuses on a model plant pathogen, Dickeya dadantii, and summarizes the current knowledge of its T3SS regulation. We highlight the roles of several T3SS regulators that were recently discovered, including the transcriptional regulators: FlhDC, RpoS, and SlyA; the post-transcriptional regulators: PNPase, Hfq with its dependent sRNA ArcZ, and the RsmA/B system; and the bacterial second messenger cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP). Homologs of these regulatory components have also been characterized in almost all major bacterial plant pathogens like Erwinia amylovora, Pseudomonas syringae, Pectobacterium spp., Xanthomonas spp., and Ralstonia spp. The second half of this review shifts focus to an in-depth discussion of the innovation and development of T3SS inhibitors, small molecules that inhibit T3SSs, in the field of plant pathology. This includes T3SS inhibitors that are derived from plant phenolic compounds, plant coumarins, and salicylidene acylhydrazides. We also discuss their modes of action in bacteria and application for controlling plant diseases. "
Paramagnetic Functionalization of Biocompatible Scaffolds for Biomedical Applications: A Perspective,"The burst of research papers focused on the tissue engineering and regeneration recorded in the last years is justified by the increased skills in the synthesis of nanostructures able to confer peculiar biological and mechanical features to the matrix where they are dispersed. Inorganic, organic and hybrid nanostructures are proposed in the literature depending on the characteristic that has to be tuned and on the effect that has to be induced. In the field of the inorganic nanoparticles used for decorating the bio-scaffolds, the most recent contributions about the paramagnetic and superparamagnetic nanoparticles use was evaluated in the present contribution. The intrinsic properties of the paramagnetic nanoparticles, the possibility to be triggered by the simple application of an external magnetic field, their biocompatibility and the easiness of the synthetic procedures for obtaining them proposed these nanostructures as ideal candidates for positively enhancing the tissue regeneration. Herein, we divided the discussion into two macro-topics: the use of magnetic nanoparticles in scaffolds used for hard tissue engineering for soft tissue regeneration. "

The Association between Plasma ERVWE1 Concentrations and Affective Symptoms during Pregnancy: Is This a Friendly Alien?,"Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) comprise 8% of the human genome, and HERV DNA was reported to be essential in human embryonic development. Specifically, HERV-W encodes a protein, syncytin-1, alternatively known as ERVWE1 (Human Endogenous Retrovirus W EnvC7-1 Envelope Protein), participating in human placental morphogenesis and having a role in immune system regulation. Syncytin-1 activity is increased in neuropsychiatric disorders, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. In our study, forty-four women in the third trimester of pregnancy were tested for ERVWE1 plasma levels. In concomitance with blood samples the following rating scales were administered to women: the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), State Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S), Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T), and Prenatal Attachment Inventory (PAI). We found that higher ERVWE1 protein plasma levels were significantly associated with higher PAI scores (p "
Mode Analysis of Pt/LGS Surface Acoustic Wave Devices,"Platinum (Pt) gratings on langasite (LGS) substrates are a widely used structures in high temperature surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices. Multiple modes can be excited in Pt/ LGS SAW devices owing to the heavy weight of the Pt electrode and leaky waves in the LGS substrate. In this work, we report on a detailed mode analysis of Pt/ LGS SAW devices, where three commonly used LGS cuts are considered. A three-dimensional (3D) finite element method (FEM) numerical model was developed, and the simulation and experiment results were compared. The experiment and simulation results showed that there are two modes excited in the Pt/ LGS SAW devices with Euler angle (0 , 138.5 , 27 ) and (0 , 138.5 , 117 ), which are Rayleigh-type SAW and SH-type leaky wave, respectively. Only the Rayleigh-type mode was observed in the Pt/ LGS SAW devices with Euler angle (0 , 138.5 , 72 ). It was found that the acoustic velocities are dependent on the wavelength, which is attributed to the change of wave penetration depth in interdigital transducers (IDTs) and the velocity dispersion can be modulated by the thickness of the Pt electrode. We also demonstrated that addition of an Al2O3 passivation layer has no effect on the wave modes, but can increase the resonant frequencies. This paper provides a better understanding of the acoustic modes of Pt/ LGS SAW devices, as well as useful guidance for device design. It is believed that the Rayleigh-type SAW and SH-type leaky waves are potentially useful for dual-mode sensing applications in harsh environments, to achieve multi-parameter monitoring or temperature-compensation on a single chip.

CDKN2A-Inactivated Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Exhibits Therapeutic Sensitivity to Paclitaxel: A Bioinformatics Study,"The mutation of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) is frequently found in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, its prognostic and therapeutic roles in PDAC have not been extensively investigated yet. In this study, we mined and integrated the cancer genomics and chemogenomics data to investigate the roles of CDKN2A genetic alterations in PDAC patients’ prognosis and treatment. We found that functional CDKN2A inactivation caused by mutations and deep deletions predicted poor prognosis in PDAC patients. CDKN2A inactivation was associated with the upregulation of genes related to estrogen response, which can be overcome by CDKN2A restoration. Chemosensitivity profiling of PDAC cell lines and patient-derived organoids found that CDKN2A inactivation was associated with the increased sensitivity to paclitaxel and SN-38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan). However, only paclitaxel can mimic the effect of CDKN2A restoration, and its drug sensitivity was correlated with genes related to estrogen response. Therefore, our study suggested that CDKN2A-inactivated PDAC patients could benefit from the precision treatment with paclitaxel, whose albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation (nab-paclitaxel) has been approved for treating PDAC.

Tomato Crop Performances under Chemical Nutrients Monitored by Electric Signal,"Fertigation is considered an efficient alternative to the enhanced use of chemical fertilizers. Since most of the fertigation systems rely on a theoretical electrical conductivity value of the nutrient solution, we tried to evaluate if this is the real need of the plants as well as if all the nutrients are needed at once. Therefore, we analyzed the electrical signals of the nutrients applied individually or in different mixes, correlating the electrical signals with the leaf gas exchange processes, studying the relation between the electrical signals and different plant phenological stages and the influence of the treatments on the lycopene content, nutritional composition, and antinutritional factors as well as the mineral bioavailability of tomato fruits cv. Brillante F1. The study was carried out in a greenhouse under controlled conditions. Ten different treatments consisting of MaEs (major elements) (V1—MgSO4, V2—KNO3, V3—K2SO4, V4—Ca(NO3)2, V5—KH2PO4, V6—KCl, V7—MgSO4 + KNO3 + KH2PO4, V8—K2SO4 + Ca(NO3)2 + KCl, V9—the mix of V1 to V6, commonly used in agricultural practices, V10—one nutrient each day) were applied daily when plants were 42 days old. The results showed that the values of the electrical signals varied depending on the treatment and the plant phenological stage. Five different trends of the electrical signals were identified. In addition, the shape of the signals varied during the day in accordance with the photosynthesis and the amount of CO2 registered. The results of the treatments’ influence on the nutritional composition and lycopene content of tomato fruits suggested that plants do not need all the nutrients at once; the highest values are registered for K2SO4 fertilization. However, this fertilizer also had the highest registered tannin, saponin, and trypsin inhibitors content, constituting a disadvantage considering the high nutritional values and lycopene content. Regarding the bioavailability of zinc, calcium, and iron for the human diet, regardless of the treatment applied, phytic acid did not affect the availability of zinc and calcium, but it had a negative impact on iron availability; also, the amount of oxalate could impair the bioavailability of calcium. The study suggests that tomato plants do not need all nutrients at once for quality fruits. However, further studies are needed in order to develop a fertigation scheme based on a smart nutrient use that provides an improved nutritional composition and mineral bioavailability. In addition, it is necessary to evaluate the influence of treatments on yield. "
Novel Microwave-Assisted Method of Y2Ti2O7 Powder Synthesis,"In the paper, a novel technique for highly dispersed pyrochlore Y2Ti2O7 is proposed. The experimental results proved that the application of microwave irradiation at a certain stage of calcination allowed synthesizing of Y2Ti2O7 in much shorter time, which ensured substantial energy savings. An increase up to 98 wt.% in the content of the preferred phase with a pyrochlore-type structure Y2Ti2O7 was obtained after 25 h of yttrium and titanium oxides calcination at a relatively low temperature of 1150 C, while the microwave-supported process took only 9 h and provided 99 wt.% of pyrochlore. The proposed technology is suitable for industrial applications, enabling the fabrication of large industrial amounts of pyrochlore without solvent chemistry and high-energy mills. It reduced the cost of both equipment and energy and made the process more environmentally friendly. The particle size and morphology did not change significantly; therefore, the microwave-assisted method can fully replace the traditional one. "
Monoclonal Antibodies and Airway Diseases,"Monoclonal antibodies, biologics, are a relatively new treatment option for severe chronic airway diseases, asthma, allergic rhinitis, and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). In this review, we focus on the physiological and pathomechanisms of monoclonal antibodies, and we present recent study results regarding their use as a therapeutic option against severe airway diseases. Airway mucosa acts as a relative barrier, modulating antigenic stimulation and responding to environmental pathogen exposure with a specific, self-limited response. In severe asthma and/or CRS, genome–environmental interactions lead to dysbiosis, aggravated inflammation, and disease. In healthy conditions, single or combined type 1, 2, and 3 immunological response pathways are invoked, generating cytokine, chemokine, innate cellular and T helper (Th) responses to eliminate viruses, helminths, and extracellular bacteria/fungi, correspondingly. Although the pathomechanisms are not fully known, the majority of severe airway diseases are related to type 2 high inflammation. Type 2 cytokines interleukins (IL) 4, 5, and 13, are orchestrated by innate lymphoid cell (ILC) and Th subsets leading to eosinophilia, immunoglobulin E (IgE) responses, and permanently impaired airway damage. Monoclonal antibodies can bind or block key parts of these inflammatory pathways, resulting in less inflammation and improved disease control. "
Powerful Plant Antioxidants: A New Biosustainable Approach to the Production of Rosmarinic Acid,"Modern lifestyle factors, such as physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and exposure to environmental pollution, induce excessive generation of free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the body. These by-products of oxygen metabolism play a key role in the development of various human diseases such as cancer, diabetes, heart failure, brain damage, muscle problems, premature aging, eye injuries, and a weakened immune system. Synthetic and natural antioxidants, which act as free radical scavengers, are widely used in the food and beverage industries. The toxicity and carcinogenic effects of some synthetic antioxidants have generated interest in natural alternatives, especially plant-derived polyphenols (e.g., phenolic acids, flavonoids, stilbenes, tannins, coumarins, lignins, lignans, quinines, curcuminoids, chalcones, and essential oil terpenoids). This review focuses on the well-known phenolic antioxidant rosmarinic acid (RA), an ester of caffeic acid and (R)-(+)-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl) lactic acid, describing its wide distribution in thirty-nine plant families and the potential productivity of plant sources. A botanical and phytochemical description is provided of a new rich source of RA, Satureja khuzistanica Jamzad (Lamiaceae). Recently reported approaches to the biotechnological production of RA are summarized, highlighting the establishment of cell suspension cultures of S. khuzistanica as an RA chemical biofactory. "
Hydrochemical Characteristics and Irrigation Suitability Evaluation of Groundwater with Different Degrees of Seawater Intrusion,"Groundwater in coastal aquifers is often affected by seawater intrusion, resulting in water quality deterioration. Using groundwater influenced by seawater intrusion for irrigation can lead to crop failure, erosion of machinery and pipes, and adverse effects on farming. In this study, the results of water testing, methods of statistical analysis, ion ratios, a Piper diagram, and a variety of groundwater irrigation suitability models were used to analyze the chemical composition of groundwater and the influence of seawater intrusion. The result shows that the content of Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, and SO42- in groundwater would increase due to seawater intrusion, and the increasing trend was consistent with the freshwater–seawater mixing line. With the deepening of seawater intrusion, the hydrochemical type gradually changes from Ca-HCO3Cl to NaMg-ClSO4 and then to Na-Cl type, and the source of hydrochemical composition changes from “Rock Weathering Dominance” to “Evaporation Dominance”. When the Cl- concentration is greater than 7.1 meq/L, groundwater will corrode pipelines and instruments; when greater than 28.2 meq/L, excessively high salinity of groundwater will have adverse effects on planting; and when greater than 14.1 meq/L, the groundwater hardness is too high, which may make the groundwater unsuitable for cultivation.

Low Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Levels Are Related to Frailty and Sarcopenia in Patients with Chronic Liver Disease,"Low vitamin D status is related to frailty and/or sarcopenia in elderly individuals. However, these relationships are unclear in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD). This study aimed at exploring the relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and frailty or sarcopenia in 231 patients with CLD. Frailty was determined based on five factors (weight loss, low physical activity, weakness, slowness, and exhaustion). Sarcopenia was diagnosed by applying the Japan Society of Hepatology criteria. The patients were classified into three groups according to baseline 25(OH)D levels: low (L), intermediate (I), and high (H) vitamin D (VD) groups. Of the 231 patients, 70 (30.3%) and 66 (28.6%) had frailty and sarcopenia, respectively. The prevalence rate of frailty and sarcopenia significantly increased stepwise with a decline in the vitamin D status. The L-VD group showed the highest prevalence rates of frailty and sarcopenia (49.1% (28/57), p < 0.001 for both), whereas the H-VD group showed the lowest prevalence rates of frailty (15.3% (9/59)) and sarcopenia (18.6% (11/59)) (p < 0.001 for both). Multivariate analysis identified serum 25(OH)D levels as a significant independent factor related to frailty and sarcopenia. Serum 25(OH)D levels significantly correlated with handgrip strength, skeletal muscle mass index, and gait speed. In conclusion, low serum vitamin D level, especially severe vitamin D deficient status, is closely related to frailty and sarcopenia in patients with CLD. "
Two-Dimensional As/BlueP van der Waals Hetero-Structure as a Promising Photocatalyst for Water Splitting: A DFT Study,"Constructing van der Waals (vdW) hetero-structure by stacking different two-dimensional (2D) materials has become an effective method for designing new-type and high-quality electronic and optoelectronic nano-devices. In this work, we designed a 2D As/BlueP vdW hetero-structure by stacking monolayer arsenene (As) and monolayer blue phosphorous (BlueP) vertically, which were recently implemented in experiments, and investigated its structural, electronic, and photocatalytic water splitting properties by using the standard first principles calculation method with HSE06 hybrid exchange-correlation functional. Numerical results show that the As/BlueP vdW hetero-structure is structural robust, even at room temperature. It presents semi-conducting behavior, and the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the valence band maximum (VBM) are dominated by BlueP and As, respectively. The typical type-II band alignment predicts the potential application of the hetero-structure in highly efficient optoelectronics and solar energy conversion. Moreover, the CBM and the VBM straddle the redox potentials of water in acid environment, predicting the possibility of the As/BlueP hetero-structure as a 2D photocatalyst for water splitting. When an in-plane strain is applied, the band edges and, further, the optoelectronic properties of the hetero-structure can be effectively tuned. Especially, when tensile strain is equal to 4.5%, the optical absorption spectrum is effectively broadened in a visible light region, which will largely improve its photocatalytic efficiency, although the pH value of the solution range reduction. This work provides theoretical evidence that the As/BlueP hetero-structure has potential application as a 2D photocatalyst in water splitting. "

Prevention of Periprosthetic Joint Infection (PJI): A Clinical Practice Protocol in High-Risk Patients,"Background: Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) represents 25% of failed total knee arthroplasties (TKA). The European Knee Associates (EKA) formed a transatlantic panel of experts to perform a literature review examining patient-related risk factors with the objective of producing perioperative recommendations in PJI high-risk patients. Methods: Multiple databases (Pubmed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library) and recommendations on TKA PJI prevention measures from the International Consensus Meetings on PJI from the AAOS and AAHKS were reviewed. This represents a Level IV study. Results: Strong evidence was found on poor glycemic control, obesity, malnutrition, and smoking being all associated with increased rates of PJI. In the preoperative period, patient optimization is key: BMI < 35, diet optimization, Hemoglobin A1c < 7.5, Fructosamine < 292 mmol/L, smoking cessation, and MRSA nasal screening all showed strong evidence on reducing PJI risk. Intraoperatively, a weight-based antibiotic prophylaxis, accurate fluid resuscitation, betadine and chlorhexidine dual skin preparation, diluted povidone iodine solution irrigation, tranexamic acid administration, and monofilament barbed triclosan-coated sutures for soft tissues closure all represented effective prevention measures. In the postoperative period, failure to reach normalization of ESR, CRP, D-dimer, and IL-6 six weeks postoperatively suggested early PJI. Conclusion: The current recommendations from this group of experts, based on published evidence, support risk stratification to identify high-risk patients requiring implementation of perioperative measures to reduce postoperative PJI.

Novel Inactivated Subtype B Avian Metapneumovirus Vaccine Induced Humoral and Cellular Immune Responses,"Avian metapneumovirus (aMPV), a highly contagious agent, is widespread and causes acute upper respiratory tract disease in chickens and turkeys. However, currently, there is no vaccine licensed in China. Herein, we describe the development of an inactivated aMPV/B vaccine using the aMPV/B strain LN16. Combined with a novel adjuvant containing immune-stimulating complexes (ISCOMs), the novel vaccine could induce high virus-specific and VN antibodies. In addition, it activated B and T lymphocytes and promoted the expression of IL-4 and IFN-. Importantly, boosting vaccination with the inactivated aMPV/B vaccine could provide 100% protection against aMPV/B infection with reduced virus shedding and turbinate inflammation. The protection efficacy could last for at least 6 months. This study yielded a novel inactivated aMPV/B vaccine that could serve as the first vaccine candidate in China, thus contributing to the control of aMPV/B and promoting the development of the poultry industry.

Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) for Resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in Common Bean,"White mold (WM) is a devastating fungal disease affecting common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). In this research, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for WM resistance was conducted using 294 lines of the Spanish diversity panel. One single-locus method and six multi-locus methods were used in the GWAS. Response to this fungus showed a continuous distribution, and 28 lines were identified as potential resistance sources, including lines of Andean and Mesoamerican origin, as well as intermediate lines between the two gene pools. Twenty-two significant associations were identified, which were organized into 15 quantitative trait intervals (QTIs) located on chromosomes Pv01, Pv02, Pv03, Pv04, Pv08, and Pv09. Seven of these QTIs were identified for the first time, whereas eight corresponded to chromosome regions previously identified in the WM resistance. In all, 468 genes were annotated in these regions, 61 of which were proposed potential candidate genes for WM resistance, based on their function related to the three main defense stages on the host: recognition (22), signal transduction (8), and defense response (31). Results obtained from this work will contribute to a better understanding of the complex quantitative resistance to WM in common bean and reveal information of significance for future breeding programs.

Comparison of Major Sudden Stratospheric Warming Impacts on the Mid-Latitude Mesosphere Based on Local Microwave Radiometer CO Observations in 2018 and 2019,"In this paper, a comparison of the impact of major sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) in the Arctic in February 2018 (SSW1) and January 2019 (SSW2) on the mid-latitude mesosphere is given. The mesospheric carbon monoxide (CO) and zonal wind in these two major SSW events were observed at altitudes of 70–85 km using a microwave radiometer (MWR) at Kharkiv, Ukraine (50.0N, 36.3E). Data from ERA-Interim and MERRA-2 reanalyses and Aura Microwave Limb Sounder measurements were also used. It is shown that: (i) The differences between SSW1 and SSW2, in terms of local variability in zonal wind, temperature, and CO in the stratosphere and mesosphere, were clearly defined by the polar vortex (westerly in cyclonic circulation) and mid-latitude anticyclone (easterly) migrating over the MWR station, therefore; (ii) mesospheric intrusions of CO-rich air into the stratosphere over the Kharkiv region occurred only occasionally, (iii) the larger zonal wave 1–3 amplitudes before SSW1 were followed by weaker polar vortex recovery than that after SSW2, (iv) the strong vortex recovery after SSW2 was supported by earlier event timing (midwinter) favoring vortex cooling due to low solar irradiance and enhanced zonal circulation, and (v) vortex strengthening after SSW2 was accompanied by wave 1–3 amplification in March 2019, which was absent after SSW1. Finally, the influence of the large-scale circulation structures formed in individual major SSW events on the locally recorded characteristics of the atmosphere is discussed. "
The Flip Teaching as Tool to Improving Students’ Sustainable Learning Performance in a Financial Course,"Flip teaching (FT) is a methodology with a significant impact on the educational innovation trend that encourages active learning and facilitates the learning of students. The main objective of this study is to measure the impact of flip teaching on the learning of a course at a higher education institution. To analyze the differences in the exam marks between students that follow FT and other methodologies, the t-statistic and Mann–Whitney U test have been used. Results indicate that FT allows improving the performance of students and achieving collateral capacities, such as responsibility and awareness, making learning more sustainable. This study makes an interesting contribution to existing research in education and demonstrates that it is possible to introduce FT in a block of the course and can be transferable to other courses.

A Simulation-Based Optimization Method for Warehouse Worker Assignment,"The general assignment problem is a classical NP-hard (non-deterministic polynomial-time) problem. In a warehouse, the constraints on the equipment and the characteristics of consecutive processes make it even more complicated. To overcome the difficulty in calculating the benefit of an assignment and in finding the optimal assignment plan, a simulation-based optimization method is introduced. We first built a simulation model of the warehouse with the object-oriented discrete-event simulation (O2DES) framework, and then implemented a random neighborhood search method utilizing the simulation output. With this method, the throughput and service level of the warehouse can be improved, while keeping the number of workers constant. Numerical results with real data demonstrate the reduction of discrepancy between inbound and outbound service level performance. With a less than 10% reduction in inbound service level, we can achieve an over 30% increase in outbound service level. The proposed decision support tool assists the warehouse manager in dealing with warehouse worker allocation problem under conditions of random daily workload. "
Aquatic Foods and Nutrition in the Pacific,"National rates of aquatic food consumption in Pacific Island Countries and Territories are among the highest in the world, yet the region is suffering from extensive levels of diet-related ill health. The aim of this paper is to examine the variation in consumption patterns and in nutrient composition of aquatic foods in the Pacific, to help improve understanding of their contribution to food and nutrition security. For this examination we analysed nutrient composition data and trade data from two novel region-specific databases, as well as consumption data from national and village level surveys for two Melanesian case studies, Vanuatu and Solomon Islands. Results demonstrated that consumption depends on availability and the amount and type of aquatic food consumed, and its contribution to nutrition security varies within different geographic and socio-demographic contexts. More data is needed on locally relevant species and consumption patterns, to better inform dietary guidelines and improve public health both now and into the future. Advice on aquatic food consumption must consider the nutrient composition and quantity of products consumed, as well as accessibility through local food systems, to ensure they contribute to diverse and healthy diets.

The Delivery of the Novel Drug ‘Halicin’ Using Electrospun Fibers for the Treatment of Pressure Ulcer against Pathogenic Bacteria,"Pressure ulcer or bedsore is a form of skin infection that commonly occurs with patients admitted to the hospital for an extended period of time, which might lead to severe complications in the absence of medical attention, resulting in infection either by drug-sensitive or drug-resistant bacteria. Halicin, a newly discovered drug effective against several bacterial strains, including multidrug-resistant bacteria, was investigated to reduce bacterial infection burden. This study aims to formulate halicin into electrospun fibers to be applied in bedsores as antibacterial dressing to assess its efficacy against gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii) by studying the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and bacterial zone of inhibition assays. The diameters of inhibition growth zones were measured, and the results have shown that the drug-loaded fibers were able to inhibit the growth of bacteria compared to the halicin discs. The release profile of the drug-loaded fibers exhibited a complete release of the drug after 2 h. The results demonstrated that the drug-loaded fibers could successfully release the drug while retaining their biological activity and they may be used as a potential antimicrobial dressing for patients with pressure ulcers caused by multidrug resistant bacteria.

Structural Basis for Design of New Purine-Based Inhibitors Targeting the Hydrophobic Binding Pocket of Hsp90,"Inhibition of the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) represents a promising approach for cancer treatment. BIIB021 is a highly potent Hsp90 inhibitor with remarkable anticancer activity; however, its clinical application is limited by lack of potency and response. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of replacing the hydrophobic moiety of BIIB021, 4-methoxy-3,5-dimethylpyridine, with various five-membered ring structures on the binding to Hsp90. A focused array of N7/N9-substituted purines, featuring aromatic and non-aromatic rings, was designed, considering the size of hydrophobic pocket B in Hsp90 to obtain insights into their binding modes within the ATP binding site of Hsp90 in terms of – stacking interactions in pocket B as well as outer -helix 4 configurations. The target molecules were synthesized and evaluated for their Hsp90 inhibitory activity in cell-free assays. Among the tested compounds, the isoxazole derivatives 6b and 6c, and the sole six-membered derivative 14 showed favorable Hsp90 inhibitory activity, with IC50 values of 1.76 M, 0.203 M, and 1.00 M, respectively. Furthermore, compound 14 elicited promising anticancer activity against MCF-7, SK-BR-3, and HCT116 cell lines. The X-ray structures of compounds 4b, 6b, 6c, 8, and 14 bound to the N-terminal domain of Hsp90 were determined in order to understand the obtained results and to acquire additional structural insights, which might enable further optimization of BIIB021.

"Intramuscular and Intradermal Electroporation of HIV-1 PENNVAX-GP® DNA Vaccine and IL-12 Is Safe, Tolerable, Acceptable in Healthy Adults","Background: Several techniques are under investigation to improve the immunogenicity of HIV-1 DNA vaccine candidates. DNA vaccines are advantageous due to their ease of design, expression of multiple antigens, and safety. Methods: The HVTN 098 trial assessed the PENNVAX®-GP DNA vaccine (encoding HIV env, gag, pol) administered with or without plasmid IL-12 at 0-, 1-, 3-, and 6-month timepoints via intradermal (ID) or intramuscular (IM) electroporation (EP) in healthy, adult participants. We report on safety, tolerability, and acceptability. Results: HVTN 098 enrolled 94 participants: 85 received PENNVAX®-GP and nine received placebo. Visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores immediately after each vaccination were lower in the ID/EP than in the IM/EP group (medians 4.1–4.6 vs. 6–6.5, p < 0.01). IM/EP participants reported greater pain and/or tenderness at the injection site. Most ID/EP participants had skin lesions such as scabs/eschars, scars, and pigmentation changes, which resolved within 6 months in 51% of participants (24/55). Eighty-two percent of IM/EP and 92% of ID/EP participant survey responses showed acceptable levels of discomfort. Conclusions: ID/EP and IM/EP are distinct experiences; however, HIV-1 DNA vaccination by either route was safe, tolerable and acceptable by most study participants. "
The Interaction of Viruses with the Cellular Senescence Response,"Cellular senescence is viewed as a mechanism to prevent malignant transformation, but when it is chronic, as occurs in age-related diseases, it may have adverse effects on cancer. Therefore, targeting senescent cells is a novel therapeutic strategy against senescence-associated diseases. In addition to its role in cancer protection, cellular senescence is also considered a mechanism to control virus replication. Both interferon treatment and some viral infections can trigger cellular senescence as a way to restrict virus replication. However, activation of the cellular senescence program is linked to the alteration of different pathways, which can be exploited by some viruses to improve their replication. It is, therefore, important to understand the potential impact of senolytic agents on viral propagation. Here we focus on the relationship between virus and cellular senescence and the reported effects of senolytic compounds on virus replication. "
Enhancing Computational Thinking through Interdisciplinary STEAM Activities Using Tablets,"Computational thinking is a highly appreciated skill by mathematicians. It was forecasted that, in the next few years, half of the jobs in science, mathematics, technology and engineering (abbreviated as STEM, including arts as STEAM) will use some kind of computation. It is therefore necessary to enhance the learning of mathematics by collaborative problem-solving activities focused on both learning mathematics and developing computational thinking. The problems in science offer a reasonable context in which to investigate the common overarching concepts (e.g., measuring the length). An interdisciplinary STEAM collaborative problem-solving activity was designed and piloted with 27 lower secondary students aged 13.07  1.21 years. Different levels of willingness to use the technology were observed and the factors influencing it were identified. We found that strong background knowledge implies high demands when controlling the used device. On the other hand, when a nice and user-friendly application was used, students did not need to perceive any control over it. After the intervention, the students’ views on the tablet changed and they reported more STEAM-related functions of the device. "
Greater Biofilm Formation and Increased Biodegradation of Polyethylene Film bya Microbial Consortium of Arthrobacter sp.and Streptomyces sp.,"The widespread use of polyethylene (PE) mulch films has led to a significant accumulation of plastic waste in agricultural soils. The biodegradation of plastic waste by microorganisms promises to provide a cost-effective and environmentally-friendly alternative for mitigating soil plastic pollution. A large number of microorganisms capable of degrading PE have been reported, but degradation may be further enhanced by the cooperative activity of multiple microbial species. Here, two novel strains of Arthrobacter sp. and Streptomyces sp. were isolated from agricultural soils and shown to grow with PE film as a sole carbon source. Arthrobacter sp. mainly grew in the suspension phase of the culture, and Streptomyces sp. formed substantial biofilms on the surface of the PE film, indicating that these strains were of different metabolic types and occupied different microenvironments with contrasting nutritional access. Individual strains were able to degrade the PE film to some extent in a 90-day inoculation experiment, as indicated by decreased hydrophobicity, increased carbonyl index and CO2 evolution, and the formation of biofilms on the film surface. However, a consortium of both strains had a much greater effect on these degradation properties. Together, these results provide new insights into the mechanisms of PE biodegradation by a microbial consortium composed of different types of microbes with possible metabolic complementarities. "
Recent Advances on Synthetic Methodology Merging C–H Functionalization and C–C Cleavage,"The functionalization of C–H bonds has become a major thread of research in organic synthesis that can be assessed from different angles, for instance depending on the type of catalyst employed or the overall transformation that is carried out. This review compiles recent progress in synthetic methodology that merges the functionalization of C–H bonds along with the cleavage of C–C bonds, either in intra- or intermolecular fashion. The manuscript is organized in two main sections according to the type of substrate in which the cleavage of the C–C bond takes place, basically attending to the scission of strained or unstrained C–C bonds. Furthermore, the related research works have been grouped on the basis of the mechanistic aspects of the different transformations that are carried out, i.e.,: (a) classic transition metal catalysis where organometallic intermediates are involved; (b) processes occurring via radical intermediates generated through the use of radical initiators or photochemically; and (c) reactions that are catalyzed or mediated by suitable Lewis or Brønsted acid or bases, where molecular rearrangements take place. Thus, throughout the review a wide range of synthetic approaches show that the combination of C–H and C–C cleavage in single synthetic operations can serve as a platform to achieve complex molecular skeletons in a straightforward manner, among them interesting carbo- and heterocyclic scaffolds.

In Vitro Tests of FDM 3D-Printed Diclofenac Sodium-Containing Implants,"One of the most promising emerging innovations in personalized medication is based on 3D printing technology. For use as authorized medications, 3D-printed products require different in vitro tests, including dissolution and biocompatibility investigations. Our objective was to manufacture implantable drug delivery systems using fused deposition modeling, and in vitro tests were performed for the assessment of these products. Polylactic acid, antibacterial polylactic acid, polyethylene terephthalate glycol, and poly(methyl methacrylate) filaments were selected, and samples with 16, 19, or 22 mm diameters and 0%, 5%, 10%, or 15% infill percentages were produced. The dissolution test was performed by a USP dissolution apparatus 1. A 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide dye (MTT)-based prolonged cytotoxicity test was performed on Caco-2 cells to certify the cytocompatibility properties. The implantable drug delivery systems were characterized by thermogravimetric and heatflow assay, contact angle measurement, scanning electron microscopy, microcomputed tomography, and Raman spectroscopy. Based on our results, it can be stated that the samples are considered nontoxic. The dissolution profiles are influenced by the material properties of the polymers, the diameter, and the infill percentage. Our results confirm the potential of fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing for the manufacturing of different implantable drug delivery systems in personalized medicine and may be applied during surgical interventions.

"Integrated Control and Protection Architecture for Islanded PV-Battery DC Microgrids: Design, Analysis and Experimental Verification","Direct current (dc) microgrids have gained significant interest in research due to dc generation/storage technologies—such as photovoltaics (PV) and batteries—increasing performance and reducing in cost. However, proper protection and control systems are critical in order to make dc microgrids feasible. This paper aims to propose a novel integrated control and protection scheme by using the state-dependent Riccati equation (SDRE) method for PV-battery based islanded dc microgrids. The dc microgrid under study consists of photovoltaic (PV) generation, a battery energy storage system (BESS), a capacitor bank and a dc load. The aims of this study are fast fault detection and voltage control of the dc load bus. To do so, the SDRE observer-controller—a nonlinear mathematical model—is employed to model the operation of the dc microgrid. Simulation results show that the proposed SDRE method is effective for fault detection and robust against external disturbances, resulting in it being capable of controlling the dc load bus voltage during disturbances. Finally, the dc microgrid and its proposed protection scheme are implemented in an experimental testbed prototype to verify the fault detection algorithm feasibility. The experimental results indicate that the SDRE scheme can effectively detect faults in a few milliseconds. "
Impact of Quercetin Encapsulation with Added Phytosterols on Bilayer Membrane and Photothermal-Alteration of Novel Mixed Soy Lecithin-Based Liposome,"This study used highly lipophilic agents with an aim to increase the oxidant inhibitory activity and enhance photothermal stability of a novel mixed soy lecithin (ML)-based liposome by changing the composition of formulation within the membrane. Specifically, the development and optimization of the liposome intended for improving Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) value and %TEAC loss was carried out by incorporating a natural antioxidant, quercetin (QU). In this context, a focus was set on QU encapsulation in ML-based liposomes and the concentration-dependent solubility of QU was investigated and calculated as encapsulation efficiency (EE). To explore the combined effects of the incorporation of plant sterols on the integrity and entrapment capacity of mixed phospholipid vesicles, conjugation of two types of phytosterols (PSs), namely -sitosterol (S) and stigmasterol (ST), to mixed membranes at different ratios was also performed. The EE measurement revealed that QU could be efficiently encapsulated in the stable ML-based liposome using 0.15 and 0.1 g/100 mL of S and ST, respectively. The aforementioned liposome complex exhibited a considerable TEAC (197.23%) and enhanced TEAC loss (30.81%) when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light (280–320 nm) over a 6 h duration. It appeared that the presence and type of PSs affect the membrane-integration characteristics as well as photodamage transformation of the ML-based liposome. The association of QU with either S or ST in the formulation was justified by their synergistic effects on the enhancement of the EE of liposomes. Parallel to this, it was demonstrated that synergistic PS effects could be in effect in the maintenance of membrane order of the ML-based liposome. The findings presented in this study provided useful information for the development and production of stable QU-loaded ML-based liposomes for food and nutraceutical applications and could serve as a potential mixed lipids-based delivery system in the disease management using antioxidant therapy.

Exploring Mental Health and Illness in the UK Sports Coaching Workforce,"There is growing international concern about the mental health of those who work in sport, including coaches. However, we currently know little about the prevalence of mental illness and the experience of mental health among coaches, and their perceptions and use of workplace mental health support services. Little is also known about coaches’ disclosure of mental illness to, and seeking help from, work colleagues. We explore these issues using data from 202 coaches who responded to the first United Kingdom survey of mental health in the sport and physical activity workforce. In total, 55% of coaches reported having ever experienced a mental illness, and 44% currently did, with coaches in grassroots/community settings being most likely to experience mental illness. Depression and anxiety were the most commonly reported conditions and many coaches preferred to access mental health support outside of the organisation for whom they worked or volunteered, with decisions to seek help from others in the workplace being shaped by complex organisational and personal considerations. The findings suggest there is an important public health challenge which needs to be met among coaches, so that we can better address a question of fundamental importance: ‘who is looking after the people looking after the people’?

Equivocal PI-RADS Three Lesions on Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Risk Stratification Strategies to Avoid MRI-Targeted Biopsies,"We aimed to investigate the relation between largest lesion diameter, prostate-specific antigen density (PSA-D), age, and the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) using first-time targeted biopsy (TBx) in men with Prostate Imaging—Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) 3 index lesions. A total of 292 men (2013–2019) from two referral centers were included. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. The discrimination and clinical utility of the built model was assessed by the area under the receiver operation curve (AUC) and decision curve analysis, respectively. A higher PSA-D and higher age were significantly related to a higher risk of detecting csPCa, while the largest index lesion diameter was not. The discrimination of the model was 0.80 (95% CI 0.73–0.87). When compared to a biopsy-all strategy, decision curve analysis showed a higher net benefit at threshold probabilities of 2%. Accepting a missing 5% of csPCa diagnoses, a risk-based approach would result in 34% of TBx sessions and 23% of low-risk PCa diagnoses being avoided. In men with PI-RADS 3 index lesions scheduled for first-time TBx, the balance between the number of TBx sessions, the detection of low-risk PCa, and the detection of csPCa does not warrant a biopsy-all strategy. To minimize the risk of missing the diagnosis of csPCa but acknowledging the need of avoiding unnecessary TBx sessions and overdiagnosis, a risk-based approach is advisable. "
Determination of the Entire Stent Surface Area by a New Analytical Method,"Stenting is a widely used treatment procedure for coronary artery disease around the world. Stents have a complex geometry, which makes the characterization of their corrosion difficult due to the absence of a mathematical model to calculate the entire stent surface area (ESSA). Therefore, corrosion experiments with stents are mostly based on qualitative analysis. Additionally, the quantitative analysis of corrosion is conducted with simpler samples made of stent material instead of stents, in most cases. At present, several methods are available to calculate the stent outer surface area (SOSA), whereas no model exists for the calculation of the ESSA. This paper presents a novel mathematical model for the calculation of the ESSA using the SOSA as one of the main parameters. The ESSA of seven magnesium alloy stents (MeKo Laser Material Processing GmbH, Sarstedt, Germany) were calculated using the developed model. The calculated SOSA and ESSA for all stents are 33.34% (0.26%) and 111.86 mm (0.85 mm), respectively. The model is validated by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), with a difference of 12.34% (0.46%). The value of corrosion rates calculated using the ESSA computed with the developed model will be 12.34% (0.46%) less than that of using ESSA obtained by micro-CT. "
Comparison between Additive and Subtractive CAD-CAM Technique to Produce Orthognathic Surgical Splints: A Personalized Approach,"The present study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of digitally designed surgical splints generated with milling technology (material subtractive procedure) and with 3D printing technology (material additive procedure) through a customized approach in the planning of surgical orthognathic splints. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) examinations and scanned dental models of 10 subjects who had required surgical treatment of skeletal malocclusion were included. Simulation of the orthognathic surgery was performed according to dento-skeletal and aesthetic characteristics of the subjects and the visual treatment objective (VTO), using Dolphin3D software (Dolphin Imaging, version 11.0, Chatsworth, CA, USA). Afterward, the Appliance Designer software (3Shape A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark) was used to digitally design the surgical splints that were generated twice using laser stereolithography technology (DWS 0.29D, DWS, Vicenza, Italy) and milling technology (Sirona inLab MC X5). Finally, each physical splint was digitalized using a desktop scanner (D500 3D, 3Shape A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark) in order to perform deviation analysis using the original project as a reference. The relative percentage of matching (trueness) was calculated (Geomagic Control X software (3D Systems, version 2018.1.1, 3D Systems, Rock Hill, SC, USA). An Independent Student’s t-test was used to statistically analyze the data. The milled splints showed a lower value of root to mean square (RMS) relative to the original project (0.20 mm  0.018) compared to the prototyped splints (0.31  0.021) (p < 0.001). According to the present findings, surgical splints generated with milling technology present higher trueness compared with 3D printing technology. "
Dissolution Enhancement and Controlled Release of Paclitaxel Drug via a Hybrid Nanocarrier Based on mPEG-PCL Amphiphilic Copolymer and Fe-BTC Porous Metal-Organic Framework,"In the present work, the porous metal-organic framework (MOF) Basolite®F300 (Fe-BTC) was tested as a potential drug-releasing depot to enhance the solubility of the anticancer drug paclitaxel (PTX) and to prepare controlled release formulations after its encapsulation in amphiphilic methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(-caprolactone) (mPEG-PCL) nanoparticles. Investigation revealed that drug adsorption in Fe-BTC reached approximately 40%, a relatively high level, and also led to an overall drug amorphization as confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The dissolution rate of PTX-loaded MOF was substantially enhanced achieving a complete (100%) release within four days, while the neat drug only reached a 13% maximum rate (3–4 days). This PTX-Fe-BTC nanocomposite was further encapsulated into a mPEG-PCL matrix, a typical aliphatic amphiphilic copolyester synthesized in our lab, whose biocompatibility was validated by in vitro cytotoxicity tests toward human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Encapsulation was performed according to the solid-in-oil-in-water emulsion/solvent evaporation technique, resulting in nanoparticles of about 143 nm, slightly larger of those prepared without the pre-adsorption of PTX on Fe-BTC (138 nm, respectively). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging revealed that spherical nanoparticles with embedded PTX-loaded Fe-BTC nanoparticles were indeed fabricated, with sizes ranging from 80 to 150 nm. Regions of the composite Fe-BTC-PTX system in the infrared (IR) spectrum are identified as signatures of the drug-MOF interaction. The dissolution profiles of all nanoparticles showed an initial burst release, attributed to the drug amount located at the nanoparticles surface or close to it, followed by a steadily and controlled release. This is corroborated by computational analysis that reveals that PTX attaches effectively to Fe-BTC building blocks, but its relatively large size limits diffusion through crystalline regions of Fe-BTC. The dissolution behaviour can be described through a bimodal diffusivity model. The nanoparticles studied could serve as potential chemotherapeutic candidates for PTX delivery. "
A Lightweight Blockchain Scheme for a Secure Smart Dust IoT Environment,"Since a smart dust Internet of Things (IoT) system includes a very large number of devices sometimes deployed in hard-access areas, it is very difficult to prevent security attacks and to alleviate bottleneck phenomena. In this paper, we propose a lightweight blockchain scheme that helps device authentication and data security in a secure smart dust IoT environment. To achieve our goals, (1) we propose the structure of the lightweight blockchain and the algorithm of processing the blockchain. In addition, (2) we reorganize the linear block structure of the conventional blockchain into the binary tree structure in such a way that the proposed blockchain is more efficient in a secure smart dust IoT environment. Experiments show that the proposed binary tree-structured lightweight blockchain scheme can greatly reduce the time required for smart dust device authentication, even taking into account the tree transformation overhead. Compared with the conventional linear-structured blockchain scheme, the proposed binary tree-structured lightweight blockchain scheme achieves performance improvement by up to 40% (10% in average) with respect to the authentication time.

"Design, Synthesis and Fungicidal Activity of New 1,2,4-Triazole Derivatives Containing Oxime Ether and Phenoxyl Pyridinyl Moiety","A series of novel 1,2,4-triazole derivatives containing oxime ether and phenoxy pyridine moiety were designed and synthesized. The new compounds were identified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Compound (Z)-1-(6-(4-nitrophenoxy)pyridin-3-yl)-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)ethan-1-one O-methyl oxime (5a18) was further confirmed by X-ray single crystal diffraction. Their antifungal activities were evaluated against eight phytopathogens. The in vitro bioassays indicated that most of the title compounds displayed moderate to high fungicidal activities. Compound (Z)-1-(6-(4-bromo-2-chlorophenoxy)pyridin-3-yl)-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)ethan-1-one O-methyl oxime (5a4) exhibited a broad-spectrum antifungal activities with the EC50 values of 1.59, 0.46, 0.27 and 11.39 mg/L against S. sclerotiorum, P. infestans, R. solani and B. cinerea, respectively. Compound (Z)-1-(6-(2-chlorophenoxy)pyridin-3-yl)-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)ethan-1-one O-benzyl oxime (5b2) provided the lowest EC50 value of 0.12 mg/L against S. sclerotiorum, which were comparable to the commercialized difenoconazole. Moreover, homologous modeling and molecular docking disclosed possible binding modes of compounds 5a4 and 5b2 with CYP51. This work provided useful guidance for the discovery of new 1,2,4-triazole fungicides. "
Heating a 2D Thermoelastic Half-Space Induced by Volumetric Absorption of a Laser Radiation,"In this work, the generalized theory with dual-phase-lag of thermoelasticity is employed to study the influences induced by absorbing a penetrating laser radiation inside a 2D thermoelastic semi-infinite medium. The medium’s surface is presumed to be exposed to temperature-dependent heat losses and is traction-free. The considered problem is solved using the integral transforms technique by applying the double-transformation Laplace and Hankel. A numerical fashion is applied to obtain the inverse of the Laplace transformation. The results of this problem are presented graphically for some studied fields. "
Mechanisms of Resistance to Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer and Possible Targets in Drug Delivery Systems,"Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most important cancers worldwide, and usually, chemotherapy can be used in an integrative approach. Usually, chemotherapy treatment is performed in association with surgery, radiation or hormone therapy, providing an increased outcome to patients. However, tumors can develop resistance to different drugs, progressing for a more aggressive phenotype. In this scenario, the use of nanocarriers could help to defeat tumor cell resistance, providing a new therapeutic perspective for patients. Thus, this systematic review aims to bring the molecular mechanisms involved in BC chemoresistance and extract from the previous literature information regarding the use of nanoparticles as potential treatment for chemoresistant breast cancer.

Advanced Micro-Actuator/Robot Fabrication Using Ultrafast Laser Direct Writing and Its Remote Control,"Two-photon polymerization (TPP) based on the femtosecond laser (fs laser) direct writing technique in the realization of high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) shapes is spotlighted as a unique and promising processing technique. It is also interesting that TPP can be applied to various applications in not only optics, chemistry, physics, biomedical engineering, and microfluidics but also micro-robotics systems. Effort has been made to design innovative microscale actuators, and research on how to remotely manipulate actuators is also constantly being conducted. Various manipulation methods have been devised including the magnetic, optical, and acoustic control of microscale actuators, demonstrating the great potential for non-contact and non-invasive control. However, research related to the precise control of microscale actuators is still in the early stages, and in-depth research is needed for the efficient control and diversification of a range of applications. In the future, the combination of the fs laser-based fabrication technique for the precise fabrication of microscale actuators/robots and their manipulation can be established as a next-generation processing method by presenting the possibility of applications to various areas.

Non-Destructive Characterization of Industrial Membrane Cartridges by Using Liquid–Liquid Displacement Porosimetry (LLDP),"This works aims to propose and demonstrate the accuracy of a novel method of characterization aimed for non-destructive analysis of microfiltration (MF) membrane cartridges. The method adapts conventional liquid–liquid displacement porosimetry (LLDP) for performing an in-line porosimetric analysis of the membrane cartridges, getting their pore size distributions (PSDs) and mean pore diameters (davg). Six commercial filtration cartridges featuring polyethersulfone (PES) pleated membranes were analyzed using a newly designed filtration rig, based on the liquid–liquid displacement porometer, developed at the Institut de la Filtration et des Techniques Séparatives (IFTS) and operated at constant flow. The experimental rig allows the direct and non-destructive characterization of the cartridge in its original presentation. Results have been compared with those obtained by using gas–liquid displacement porosimetry (GLDP) on small membrane coupons detached from such cartridges. The comparison allows us to conclude that the proposed method gives enough accuracy in the determination of porosimetric characteristics of the filters. This method can be used as a precise characterization technique for a non-destructive in-line study of filter performance and can be envisaged as useful to periodic quality or fouling control of the commercial cartridges.

Widespread Aberrant Alternative Splicing despite Molecular Remission in Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia Patients,"Vast transcriptomics and epigenomics changes are characteristic of human cancers, including leukaemia. At remission, we assume that these changes normalise so that omics-profiles resemble those of healthy individuals. However, an in-depth transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis of cancer remission has not been undertaken. A striking exemplar of targeted remission induction occurs in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) following tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Using RNA sequencing and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, we profiled samples from chronic-phase CML patients at diagnosis and remission and compared these to healthy donors. Remarkably, our analyses revealed that abnormal splicing distinguishes remission samples from normal controls. This phenomenon is independent of the TKI drug used and in striking contrast to the normalisation of gene expression and DNA methylation patterns. Most remarkable are the high intron retention (IR) levels that even exceed those observed in the diagnosis samples. Increased IR affects cell cycle regulators at diagnosis and splicing regulators at remission. We show that aberrant splicing in CML is associated with reduced expression of specific splicing factors, histone modifications and reduced DNA methylation. Our results provide novel insights into the changing transcriptomic and epigenomic landscapes of CML patients during remission. The conceptually unanticipated observation of widespread aberrant alternative splicing after remission induction warrants further exploration. These results have broad implications for studying CML relapse and treating minimal residual disease. "
Regulation of Oncogenic Targets by the Tumor-Suppressive miR-139 Duplex (miR-139-5p and miR-139-3p) in Renal Cell Carcinoma,"We previously found that both the guide and passenger strands of the miR-139 duplex (miR-139-5p and miR-139-3p, respectively) were downregulated in cancer tissues. Analysis of TCGA datasets revealed that low expression of miR-139-5p (p < 0.0001) and miR-139-3p (p < 0.0001) was closely associated with 5-year survival rates of patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Ectopic expression assays showed that miR-139-5p and miR-139-3p acted as tumor-suppressive miRNAs in RCC cells. Here, 19 and 22 genes were identified as putative targets of miR-139-5p and miR-139-3p in RCC cells, respectively. Among these genes, high expression of PLXDC1, TET3, PXN, ARHGEF19, ELK1, DCBLD1, IKBKB, and CSF1 significantly predicted shorter survival in RCC patients according to TCGA analyses (p < 0.05). Importantly, the expression levels of four of these genes, PXN, ARHGEF19, ELK1, and IKBKB, were independent prognostic factors for patient survival (p < 0.05). We focused on PXN (paxillin) and investigated its potential oncogenic role in RCC cells. PXN knockdown significantly inhibited cancer cell migration and invasion, possibly by regulating epithelial–mesenchymal transition. Involvement of the miR-139-3p passenger strand in RCC molecular pathogenesis is a new concept. Analyses of tumor-suppressive-miRNA-mediated molecular networks provide important insights into the molecular pathogenesis of RCC. "
Progressive Early-Onset Leukodystrophy Related to Biallelic Variants in the KARS Gene: The First Case Described in Latin America,"The KARS gene encodes the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS), which activates and joins lysine with its corresponding transfer RNA (tRNA) through the ATP-dependent aminoacylation of the amino acid. KARS gene mutations have been linked to diverse neurologic phenotypes, such as neurosensorial hearing loss, leukodystrophy, microcephaly, developmental delay or regression, peripheral neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, the impairment of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and hyperlactatemia, among others. This article presents the case of a Colombian pediatric patient with two pathological missense variants in a compound heterozygous state in the KARS gene and, in addition to the case report, the paper reviews the literature for other cases of KARS1-associated leukodystrophy.

Repositioning of Ligands That Target the Spike Glycoprotein as Potential Drugs for SARS-CoV-2 in an In Silico Study,"The worldwide health emergency of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the absence of a specific treatment for this new coronavirus have led to the use of computational strategies (drug repositioning) to search for treatments. The aim of this work is to identify FDA (Food and Drug Administration)-approved drugs with the potential for binding to the spike structural glycoprotein at the hinge site, receptor binding motif (RBM), and fusion peptide (FP) using molecular docking simulations. Drugs that bind to amino acids are crucial for conformational changes, receptor recognition, and fusion of the viral membrane with the cell membrane. The results revealed some drugs that bind to hinge site amino acids (varenicline, or steroids such as betamethasone while other drugs bind to crucial amino acids in the RBM (naldemedine, atovaquone, cefotetan) or FP (azilsartan, maraviroc, and difluprednate); saquinavir binds both the RBM and the FP. Therefore, these drugs could inhibit spike glycoprotein and prevent viral entry as possible anti-COVID-19 drugs. Several drugs are in clinical studies; by focusing on other pharmacological agents (candesartan, atovaquone, losartan, maviroc and ritonavir) in this work we propose an additional target: the spike glycoprotein. These results can impact the proposed use of treatments that inhibit the first steps of the virus replication cycle. "
Exploring Factors Affecting Sustainable Innovation Performance of Food Firms. A Case of Korean Food Industry,"This study examines the influence of government support, research and development (R&D) investment and cooperation networks on sustainable innovation performance of the medium-sized food firms in South Korea. Climate change, population growth, lifestyle change and consumer demands for new products allow firms to explore innovation for sustainable growth. In the food industry, where various stakeholders are involved in the value chain, government support, R&D investment and cooperation are affecting firms’ sustainable performance. However, there are few empirical studies that examine the relationship among them, especially regarding medium-sized food firms. This study aimed to analyze data regarding Korean food firms through a structural equation model. To overcome data scarcity, this study collected new data for 67 medium-sized food firms. The data is matched with the firms’ 10-year data on management, innovation performance, and cooperation networks. This study can contribute to filling the literature gap by exploring what innovation strategies should be used to improve food SMEs’ innovation performance in the latecomer countries, which have developed their food industries relatively recently.

A Decision Support System for Water Optimization in Anti-Frost Techniques by Sprinklers,"Precision agriculture is a growing sector that improves traditional agricultural processes through the use of new technologies. In southeast Spain, farmers are continuously fighting against harsh conditions caused by the effects of climate change. Among these problems, the great variability of temperatures (up to 20 C in the same day) stands out. This causes the stone fruit trees to flower prematurely and the low winter temperatures freeze the flower causing the loss of the crop. Farmers use anti-freeze techniques to prevent crop loss and the most widely used techniques are those that use water irrigation as they are cheaper than other techniques. However, these techniques waste too much water and it is a scarce resource, especially in this area. In this article, we propose a novel intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) monitoring system to optimize the use of water in these anti-frost techniques while minimizing crop loss. The intelligent component of the IoT system is designed using an approach based on a multivariate Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, designed to predict low temperatures. We compare the proposed approach of multivariate model with the univariate counterpart version to figure out which model obtains better accuracy to predict low temperatures. An accurate prediction of low temperatures would translate into significant water savings, as anti-frost techniques would not be activated without being necessary. Our experimental results show that the proposed multivariate LSTM approach improves the univariate counterpart version, obtaining an average quadratic error no greater than 0.65 C and a coefficient of determination R2 greater than 0.97. The proposed system has been deployed and is currently operating in a real environment obtained satisfactory performance.  "
Enhancing Healthcare Decision-Making Process: Findings from Orthopaedic Field,"In the healthcare field, the decision-making process is part of the broad spectrum of “clinical reasoning”, which is recognised as the whole process by which a physician decides about patients’ treatments and cares. Several clinicians’ intrinsic variables lead to this decisional path. Little is known about the inference of these variables in triggering biases in decisions about the post-discharge period in the surgical field. Accordingly, this research aims to understand if and how cognitive biases can affect orthopaedists in decision-making regarding the follow-up after knee and hip arthroplasty. To achieve this goal, an interview-based explorative case study was run. Three key-decisional orthopaedic surgeons were interviewed through a quality control tool aimed at monitoring the causes and effects of cognitive distortions. Coherently with the literature, eight biases come to light. All the interviewees agree on the presence of four common biases in orthopaedic surgery (Affect heuristic, Anchoring, Halo effect, Saliency). The other biases (Groupthink, Availability, Overconfidence, Confirmation), instead, depending on specific physicians’ intrinsic variables; namely: (i) working experience; (ii) working context. This finding contributes to the debate about the application of cognitive tools as leverage for improving the quality of clinical decision-making process and, indirectly, enhancing better healthcare outcomes.

Thermal Insulation and Sound Absorption Properties of Open-Cell Polyurethane Foams Modified with Bio-Polyol Based on Used Cooking Oil,"The main goal of this work was to evaluate the thermal insulation and sound absorption properties of open-cell rigid polyurethane foams synthesized with different contents of cooking oil-based polyol. The content of the applied bio-polyol as well as flame retardant (triethyl phosphate) in the foam formulation had a significant influence on the cellular structures of the materials. The open-cell polyurethane foams were characterized by apparent densities in the range 16–30 kg/m3. The sound absorption coefficients of the polyurethanes with various contents of bio-polyol were determined using the standing wave method (Kundt’s tube) in the frequency range of 100–6300 Hz. The effect of the content of the bio-polyol and flame retardant on the coefficient of thermal conductivity (at average temperatures of 0, 10 and 20 C) as well as the compressive strength (at 20 and -10 C) was analyzed. Different trends were observed in terms of the thermal insulation properties and sound absorption ability of the open-cell polyurethanes due to the addition of bio-polyol. In conclusion, it is necessary to use systems containing both petrochemical and bio-based raw materials. "

Optimization of Machine Learning in Various Situations Using ICT-Based TVOC Sensors,"A computational framework using artificial intelligence (AI) has been suggested in numerous fields, such as medicine, robotics, meteorology, and chemistry. The specificity of each AI model and the relationship between data characteristics and ground truth, allowing their guidance according to each situation, has not been given. Since TVOCs (total volatile organic compounds) cause serious harm to human health and plants, the prevention of such damages with a reduction in their occurrence frequency becomes not an optional process but an essential one in manufacturing, as well as for chemical industries and laboratories. In this study, with consideration of the characteristics of the machine learning technique and ICT (information and communications technology), TVOC sensors are explored as a function of grounded data analysis and the selection of machine learning models, determining their performance in real situations. For representative scenarios, considering features from an ICT semiconductor sensor and one targeting TVOC gas, we investigated suitable analysis methods and machine learning models such as LSTM (long short-term memory), GRU (gated recurrent unit), and RNN (recurrent neural network). Detailed factors for these machine learning models with respect to the concentration of TVOC gas in the atmosphere are compared with original sensory data to obtain their accuracy. From this work, we expect to significantly minimize risk in empirical applications, i.e., maintaining homeostasis or predicting abnormal situations to construct an opportune response. "
"The Integration of Recycling Cooperatives in the Formal Management of Municipal Solid Waste as a Strategy for the Circular Economy—The Case of Londrina, Brazil","In many developing countries, the informal recycling sector is responsible for reducing the amount of waste in landfills and supplying the needs of recycling industries. In the context of municipal solid waste (MSW) management, considering that developing countries aim to implement circular economy (CE) actions, it is essential to ensure the inclusion of waste pickers (catadores) in an adapted CE structure. This study analyzes the integration of recycling cooperatives in the formal management of municipal solid waste with recyclable potential (MSWRP) of a medium-sized municipality in Brazil, with the objective of ascertaining the contributions of cooperatives in an adapted CE structure and, at the same time, identifying a cooperative that can be used as a benchmarking option for other cooperatives, especially in relation to their organizational and operational practices. The results indicate that from this integration, cooperatives have legal responsibility in the management of MSWRP, resulting in the professionalization of its members and increasing their productivity. The results also revealed that the implementation of the CE in developing countries is, in a sense, conditioned to the performance of the informal sector in the recycling chain and, in addition, that the inclusion of cooperatives in the formal sector of MSWRP management can improve the rates of a municipality.

Robust Resonant Controllers for Distributed Energy Resources in Microgrids,"Motivated by the problem of different types and variations of load in micro-grids, this paper presents robust proportional-resonant controllers with a harmonics compensator based on the internal model principle. These controllers ensure robust tracking of sinusoidal reference signals in distributed energy resource systems subject to load variation with respect to sinusoidal disturbances. The distributed generation resource and the resonant controllers are described using the augmented state system approach, allowing the application of the state feedback technique. In order to minimize the tracking error and ensure robustness against perturbation, a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are addressed for the synthesizing of controller gains. Finally, results obtained in the simulation for resonant compensators with the distributed energy system are presented, in which the controller is applied to the CC-CA inverter. "

Factors of the Technology Acceptance Model for Construction IT,"The use of information technology is spreading in the construction field. However, the use of information technology in the construction field does not conform to the requirements and characteristics of users who use information technology. This fact is blindly accepted by the government and client demands, which is an impediment to the dissemination of information technology in the construction field. To improve the use of information technology in the construction field, this study analyzes the factors of acceptance of information technology according to the characteristics of users who use information technology in the construction field based on Davis’ technology acceptance model. As a result of the analysis, we found that if users consider IT in the construction industry easy to use, spontaneous attitude and behavioral intention are to be expected. Moreover, acceptance type, educational satisfaction, usage enjoyment, and usage experience are the factors that impact perceived usefulness, and educational satisfaction and usage enjoyment impact perceived ease of use as well. This study aims to derive factors that maximize the approachability and usefulness of users through the use of a technology acceptance model in construction prior to the application of new information technology in the construction field.

Effect of Soaking Time and Salt Concentration on Mechanical Characteristics of Slip Zone Soil of Loess Landslides,"Loess landslides are closely related to the variation in mechanical properties of soils due to the leaching of irrigation water in the irrigation area which causes the loss of soluble salt in the loess stratum. To investigate the effect of leaching on the mechanical characteristics of loess, ring shear tests were conducted on the slip zone soil samples obtained from a typical loess landslide under different soaking time and salt concentration. Furthermore, the microstructural observations were made on shear planes by using SEM (scanning electron microscopy) tests. The experiment revealed that: firstly, the shear strength of loess decreases with the increase of soaking time before reaching the minimum value at the soaking time of 1 d, and then increases with the soaking time until reaching a relatively stable value. Secondly, the shear strength of loess has an increasing tendency with the salt concentration before reaching a maximum value at the salt concentration of 8%, and then shear strength decreases. In addition, a “stress-softening” was found for the loess samples with the soaking time of 1 d and salt concentration of 8%. It is found that the total number of micropores and small-pores in loess samples decreases with increasing salt concentration up to 8%, but increases rapidly between salt contents of 8% and 20%. The SEM tests showed that the increase in salt concentration (0% to 8%) facilities the formation of small aggregates within loess soils, which in turn promotes the increasing of shear strength. However, further increase in salt concentration (8% to 20%) helps the development of relatively large aggregates in loess samples, resulting in the reduction in shear strength. "
Pyrolysis Kinetic Properties of Thermal Insulation Waste Extruded Polystyrene by Multiple Thermal Analysis Methods,"Extruded polystyrene (XPS) is a thermal insulation material extensively applied in building systems. It has attracted much attention because of outstanding thermal insulation performance, obvious flammability shortcoming and potential energy utilization. To establish the reaction mechanism of XPS’s pyrolysis, thermogravimetric experiments were performed at different heating rates in nitrogen, and multiple methods were employed to analyze the major kinetics of pyrolysis. More accurate kinetic parameters of XPS were estimated by four common model-free methods. Then, three model-fitting methods (including the Coats-Redfern, the iterative procedure and masterplots method) were used to establish the kinetic model. Since the kinetic models established by the above three model-fitting methods were not completely consistent based on different approximations, considering the effect of different approximates on the model, the reaction mechanism was further established by comparing the conversion rate based on the model-fitting methods corresponding to the possible reaction mechanisms. Finally, the accuracy of the above model-fitting methods and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm were compared. Results showed that the reaction function g() "
Mitigation of Osmotic Stress in Cotton for the Improvement in Growth and Yield through Inoculation of Rhizobacteria and Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria Coated Diammonium Phosphate,"Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is one of the major fiber crops. Its production is under threat due to scarcity of water resources under a changing climatic scenario. Limited water availability also decreases the uptake of phosphorus, and less uptake of phosphorus can deteriorate the quality attributes of cotton fiber. There is a need to introduce bio-organic amendments which can mitigate osmotic stress on a sustainable basis. Inoculation of rhizobacteria can play an imperative role in this regard. Rhizobacteria can not only improve the growth of roots but also enhance the availability of immobile phosphorus in soil. That is why the current experiment was conducted to explore and compare the efficacy of sole application of diammonium phosphate (DAP) over plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and phosphorus solubilizing bacteria (PSB) coated DAP on growth and quality attributes of cotton under artificially induced osmotic stress at flowering stage. The impact of phosphorus levels was found to be significant on the plant height, leaf area, average boll weight, stomatal conductance, net photosynthetic rate, and seed cotton yield, while the irrigation effect was significant on all the parameters. The PGPR coated phosphorus performed better as compared to other treatments under normal irrigation and osmotic stress. Results showed that PGPR coated phosphorus increased by 29.47%, 21.01%, 41.11%, 32.73%, 15.63% and 22.89% plant height, average boll weight, stomatal conductance, net photosynthetic rate, fiber length, and seed cotton yield respectively. In conclusion, PGPR coated DAP can be helpful to get higher cotton productivity as compared to control and sole application of DAP under normal irrigation and osmotic stress. "

Evaluation of Resistance to Fescue Toxicosis in Purebred Angus Cattle Utilizing Animal Performance and Cytokine Response,"Fescue toxicosis is a multifaceted syndrome common in cattle grazing endophyte-infected tall fescue; however, varying symptomatic responses potentially imply genetic tolerance to the syndrome. It was hypothesized that a subpopulation of animals within a herd would develop tolerance to ergot alkaloid toxicity. Therefore, the goals of this study were to develop selection criteria to identify tolerant and susceptible animals within a herd based on animal performance, and then examine responsive phenotypic and cytokine profiles to fescue toxicosis. Angus cows grazed endophyte-infected tall fescue at two locations for 13 weeks starting in mid-April 2016. Forage measurements were collected to evaluate ergot alkaloid exposure during the study. A post hoc analysis of animal performance was utilized to designate cattle into either tolerant or susceptible groups, and weekly physiological measurements and blood samples were collected to evaluate responses to chronic exposure to endophyte-infected tall fescue. Findings from this study support the proposed fescue toxicosis selection method formulated herein, could accurately distinguish between tolerant and susceptible animals based on the performance parameters in cattle chronically exposed to ergot alkaloids, and provides evidence to warrant additional analysis to examine the impact of ergot alkaloids on immune responsiveness in cattle experiencing fescue toxicosis.

Morolic Acid 3-O-Caffeate Inhibits Adipogenesis by Regulating Epigenetic Gene Expression,"Obesity causes a wide range of metabolic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and kidney disease. Thus, plenty of studies have attempted to discover naturally derived compounds displaying anti-obesity effects. In this study, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of morolic acid 3-O-caffeate (MAOC), extracted from Betula schmidtii, on adipogenesis. Treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with MAOC during adipogenesis significantly reduced lipid accumulation and decreased the expression of adiponectin, a marker of mature adipocytes. Moreover, the treatment with MAOC only during the early phase (day 0–2) sufficiently inhibited adipogenesis, comparable with the inhibitory effects observed following MAOC treatment during the whole processes of adipogenesis. In the early phase of adipogenesis, the expression level of Wnt6, which inhibits adipogenesis, increased by MAOC treatment in 3T3-L1 cells. To identify the gene regulatory mechanism, we assessed alterations in histone modifications upon MAOC treatment. Both global and local levels on the Wnt6 promoter region of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation, an active transcriptional histone marker, increased markedly by MAOC treatment in 3T3-L1 cells. Our findings identified an epigenetic event associated with inhibition of adipocyte generation by MAOC, suggesting its potential as an efficient therapeutic compound to cure obesity and metabolic diseases.

"Stochastic Unit Commitment Problem, Incorporating Wind Power and an Energy Storage System","This paper presents a modified formulation for the wind-battery-thermal unit commitment problem that combines battery energy storage systems with thermal units to compensate for the power dispatch gap caused by the intermittency of wind power generation. The uncertainty of wind power is described by a chance constraint to escape the probabilistic infeasibility generated by classical approximations of wind power. Furthermore, a mixed-integer linear programming algorithm was applied to solve the unit commitment problem. The uncertainty of wind power was classified as a sub-problem and separately computed from the master problem of the mixed-integer linear programming. The master problem tracked and minimized the overall operation cost of the entire model. To ensure a feasible and efficient solution, the formulation of the wind-battery-thermal unit commitment problem was designed to gather all system operating constraints. The solution to the optimization problem was procured on a personal computer using a general algebraic modeling system. To assess the performance of the proposed model, a simulation study based on the ten-unit power system test was applied. The effects of battery energy storage and wind power were deeply explored and investigated throughout various case studies. "
Observer-Based Event-Triggered Predictive Control for Networked Control Systems under DoS Attacks,"This paper studies the problem of DoS attack defense based on static observer-based event-triggered predictive control in networked control systems (NCSs). First, under the conditions of limited network bandwidth resources and the incomplete observability of the state of the system, we introduce the event-triggered function to provide a discrete event-triggered transmission scheme for the observer. Then, we analyze denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that occur on the network transmission channel. Using the above-mentioned event-triggered scheme, a novel class of predictive control algorithms is designed on the control node to proactively save network bandwidth and compensate for DoS attacks, which ensures the stability of NCSs. Meanwhile, a closed-loop system with an observer-based event-triggered predictive control scheme for analysis is created. Through linear matrix inequality (LMI) and the Lyapunov function method, the design of the controller, observer and event-triggered matrices is established, and the stability of the scheme is analyzed. The results show that the proposed solution can effectively compensate DoS attacks and save network bandwidth resources by combining event-triggered mechanisms. Finally, a smart grid simulation example is employed to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the scheme's defense against DoS attacks. "
Fabrication and Characterization of Aluminum Nanoparticle-Reinforced Composites,"With the expanding use of polymers in modern our lives, there is an increasing need to manufacture advanced engineering polymeric parts in a systematic and inexpensive way. Herein, we developed an organic inorganic hybrid composite material with excellent mechanical properties by enhancing the dispersion and moldability of fillers. For this, we prepared and analyzed the physical properties of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS)/aluminum nanoparticle composites. Al nanoparticles of various sizes (20 nm and 40 nm) and concentrations (3, 6, 9, and 12 wt.%) were employed. The mechanical properties of the prepared composites were measured using a universal testing machine. Rheological and thermal analyses for the composites were carried out with use of a rheometer and a differential thermal calorimeter (DSC). We also conducted optical, chemical, electrical, and morphological property studies of the samples in order to help design and produce high-performance engineering products. "
The Link between Obesity and Inflammatory Markers in the Development of Type 2 Diabetes in Men of Black African and White European Ethnicity,"In this study, we aimed to assess ethnic differences in visceral (VAT), deep subcutaneous (dSAT), and superficial subcutaneous (sSAT) adipose tissue and their relationships with inflammatory markers between white European (WE) and black West African (BWA) men with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Forty-two WE (23 NGT/19 T2D) and 43 BWA (23 NGT/20 T2D) men underwent assessment of plasma inflammatory markers using immunoassays alongside Dixon magnetic resonance imaging to quantify L4-5 VAT, dSAT and sSAT.

Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines in the Formation of the Pre-Metastatic Niche,"In the presence of a primary tumor, the pre-metastatic niche is established in secondary organs as a favorable microenvironment for subsequent tumor metastases. This process is orchestrated by bone marrow-derived cells, primary tumor-derived factors, and extracellular matrix. In this review, we summarize the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1, CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), and Chemokine (C–X–C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) in the formation of the pre-metastatic niche according to the most recent studies. Pro-inflammatory cytokines released from tumor cells or stromal cells act in both autocrine and paracrine manners to induce phenotype changes in tumor cells, recruit bone marrow-derived cells, and form an inflammatory milieu, all of which prime a secondary organ’s microenvironment for metastatic cell colonization. Considering the active involvement of pro-inflammatory cytokines in niche formation, clinical strategies targeting them offer ways to inhibit the establishment of the pre-metastatic niche and therefore attenuate metastatic progression. We review clinical trials targeting different inflammatory cytokines in patients with metastatic cancers. Due to the pleiotropy and redundancy of pro-inflammatory cytokines, combined therapies should be designed in the future. "
Phylodynamic Analysis and Implication of HCV Genotype 4 Variability on Antiviral Drug Response and T-Cell Recognition,"Therapies for HCV care could change the prevalence and the geographic distribution of genotypes due to differences in Sustained Virologic Response (SVR). In this scenario, uncommon genotypes/subtypes, such as genotype 4, could spread from high-risk groups, replacing genotypes eradicated by antiviral drugs. Genotype eradication is also strongly influenced by the CD8+ T cell response. In this study, the genetic variability in HCV genotype 4 strains obtained from a cohort of 67 patients naïve to DAA therapy was evaluated. We found that the presence of resistance-associated substitutions (RAS) was able to affect drug responses. Next, using a prediction tool, viral mutations were identified by their ability, or lack thereof, to reduce the binding affinity with HLA, which affects T cell recognition. The Bayesian coalescent analysis suggested two different circulation clusters, one in risk groups (IDUs and MSM) and the other due to migration flows, dated to 1940 and 1915, respectively. Most of the RAS overlapped with HLA and a lack of binding mutations was observed in 96% of strains. This study describes the introduction of HCV genotype 4 in a region of the Mediterranean basin and evaluates how HCV genotype 4’s genetic variability could affect the response of antiviral drugs and CD8+ T cell recognition.

Practical Controller Design of Three-Phase Dual Active Bridge Converter for Low Voltage DC Distribution System,"In a low voltage DC (LVDC) distribution system, isolated bi-directional DC-DC converters are key devices to control power flows. A three-phase dual-active-bridge (3P-DAB) converter is one of the suitable candidates due to inherent soft-switching capability, low conduction loss, and high-power density. However, the 3P-DAB converter requires a well-designed controller due to the influence of the equivalent series resistance (ESR) of an output filter capacitor, degrading the performance of the 3P-DAB converter in terms of high-frequency noise. Unfortunately, there is little research that considers the practical design methodology of the 3P-DAB converter’s controller because of its complexity. In this paper, the influence of the ESR on the 3P-DAB converter is presented. Additionally, the generalized average small-signal model (SSM) of the 3P-DAB converter including the ESR of the capacitive output filter is presented. Based on this model, an extended small-signal model and appropriate controller design guide, and performance comparison are presented based on the frequency domain analysis. Finally, experimental results verify the validity of the proposed controller using a 25 kW prototype 3P-DAB converter. "
Blockage of Squamous Cancer Cell Collective Invasion by FAK Inhibition Is Released by CAFs and MMP-2,"Metastasis remains a clinically unsolved issue in cancer that is initiated by the acquisition of collective migratory properties of cancer cells. Phenotypic and functional heterogeneity that arise among cancer cells within the same tumor increase cellular plasticity and promote metastasis, however, their impact on collective cell migration is incompletely understood. Here, we show that in vitro collective cancer cell migration depends on FAK and MMP-2 and on the presence of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The absence of functional FAK rendered cancer cells incapable of invading the surrounding stroma. However, CAFs and cancer cells over-expressing MMP-2 released FAK-deficient cells from this constraint by taking the leader positions in the invasive tracks, pushing FAK-deficient squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells towards the stroma and leading to the transformation of non-invasive cells into invasive cells. Our cell-based studies and the RNAseq data from the TCGA cohort of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas reveal that, although both FAK and MMP-2 over-expression are associated with epithelial–mesenchymal transition, it is only MMP-2, not FAK, that functions as an independent prognostic factor. Given the significant role of MMP-2 in cancer dissemination, targeting of this molecule, better than FAK, presents a more promising opportunity to block metastasis.15pt "
Resveratrol-Based Multivitamin Supplement Increases Sperm Concentration and Motility in Idiopathic Male Infertility: A Pilot Clinical Study,"Background. It is known that a multitude of factors may lead to male factor infertility, but still, in the majority of cases, the cause remains largely idiopathic, reflecting poor understanding of the basic process of spermatogenesis and the mechanisms involved. Resveratrol is a polyphenol compound that displays several cellular aspects mainly associated with SIRT1-pathway activation and promotion of mitochondrial enhancer activities. In several animal models, resveratrol has shown positive effects on mitochondria and membrane potential. This could explain effects on sperm concentration and motility. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects on the semen parameters of GENANTE®, a multivitamin supplement containing 150 mg of resveratrol/day, in patients with idiopathic infertility. Methods. This was a prospective single center clinical study. Twenty patients took a multivitamin supplement based on 150 mg of resveratrol (GENANTE®), in the form of an oral tablet every 12 h, and were followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment.

Top-Down Estimation of Particulate Matter Emissions from Extreme Tropical Peatland Fires Using Geostationary Satellite Fire Radiative Power Observations,"Extreme fires in the peatlands of South East (SE) Asia are arguably the world’s greatest biomass burning events, resulting in some of the worst ambient air pollution ever recorded (PM10 > 3000 gm-3). The worst of these fires coincide with El Niño related droughts, and include huge areas of smouldering combustion that can persist for months. However, areas of flaming surface vegetation combustion atop peat are also seen, and we show that the largest of these latter fires appear to be the most radiant and intensely smoke-emitting areas of combustion present in such extreme fire episodes. Fire emissions inventories and early warning of the air quality impacts of landscape fire are increasingly based on the fire radiative power (FRP) approach to fire emissions estimation, including for these SE Asia peatland fires. “Top-down” methods estimate total particulate matter emissions directly from FRP observations using so-called “smoke emission coefficients” [Ce; gMJ-1], but currently no discrimination is made between fire types during such calculations. We show that for a subset of some of the most thermally radiant peatland fires seen during the 2015 El Niño, the most appropriate Ce is around a factor of three lower than currently assumed (~16.8  1.6 gMJ-1 vs. 52.4 gMJ-1). Analysis indicates that this difference stems from these highly radiant fires containing areas of substantial flaming combustion, which changes the amount of particulate matter emitted per unit of observable fire radiative heat release in comparison to more smouldering dominated events. We also show that even a single one of these most radiant fires is responsible for almost 10% of the overall particulate matter released during the 2015 fire event, highlighting the importance of this fire type to overall emission totals. Discriminating these different fires types in ways demonstrated herein should thus ultimately improve the accuracy of SE Asian fire emissions estimates derived using the FRP approach, and the air quality modelling which they support.

Classification of Biodegradable Substances Using Balanced Random Trees and Boosted C5.0 Decision Trees,"Substances that do not degrade over time have proven to be harmful to the environment and are dangerous to living organisms. Being able to predict the biodegradability of substances without costly experiments is useful. Recently, the quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) models have proposed effective solutions to this problem. However, the molecular descriptor datasets usually suffer from the problems of unbalanced class distribution, which adversely affects the efficiency and generalization of the derived models. Accordingly, this study aims at validating the performances of balanced random trees (RTs) and boosted C5.0 decision trees (DTs) to construct QSAR models to classify the ready biodegradation of substances and their abilities to deal with unbalanced data. The balanced RTs model algorithm builds individual trees using balanced bootstrap samples, while the boosted C5.0 DT is modeled using cost-sensitive learning. We employed the two-dimensional molecular descriptor dataset, which is publicly available through the University of California, Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository. The molecular descriptors were ranked according to their contributions to the balanced RTs classification process. The performance of the proposed models was compared with previously reported results. Based on the statistical measures, the experimental results showed that the proposed models outperform the classification results of the support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and discrimination analysis (DA). Classification measures were analyzed in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, false positive rate, false negative rate, F1 score, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and area under the ROC curve (AUROC).

"De Novo Nucleic Acids: A Review of Synthetic Alternatives to DNA and RNA That Could Act as Bio-Information Storage Molecules ""2279","Modern terran life uses several essential biopolymers like nucleic acids, proteins and polysaccharides. The nucleic acids, DNA and RNA are arguably life’s most important, acting as the stores and translators of genetic information contained in their base sequences, which ultimately manifest themselves in the amino acid sequences of proteins. But just what is it about their structures; an aromatic heterocyclic base appended to a (five-atom ring) sugar-phosphate backbone that enables them to carry out these functions with such high fidelity? In the past three decades, leading chemists have created in their laboratories synthetic analogues of nucleic acids which differ from their natural counterparts in three key areas as follows: (a) replacement of the phosphate moiety with an uncharged analogue, (b) replacement of the pentose sugars ribose and deoxyribose with alternative acyclic, pentose and hexose derivatives and, finally, (c) replacement of the two heterocyclic base pairs adenine/thymine and guanine/cytosine with non-standard analogues that obey the Watson–Crick pairing rules. This manuscript will examine in detail the physical and chemical properties of these synthetic nucleic acid analogues, in particular on their abilities to serve as conveyors of genetic information. If life exists elsewhere in the universe, will it also use DNA and RNA? "

Recent Advances in Saffron Soil Remediation: Activated Carbon and Zeolites Effects on Allelopathic Potential,"Saffron (Crocus sativus L.) is a highly valuable plant. Iran provides nearly 90% of the world’s total saffron and is the biggest global producer. The allelopathic effects of saffron corm (SC) and saffron field soil (SFS) have been hypothesized to play an important role in replanting. Recently, adsorbent materials have been used to neutralize the effects of allelochemicals. These materials, including activated carbon and zeolite, have large surface areas, pore volumes, as well as tremendous adsorptive capacity and complex chemical and physical properties. In this study, three independent experiments were conducted. In the first test, the allelopathic effects of aqueous and methanolic extracts of SC remnant and 9-year-old SFS as well as filtered aqueous extract of soil were investigated. In the second assay, the effects of SC remnants and SFS with different ages (i.e., 4, 6, and 9 years old) in combination with adsorbents were examined on the germination and growth of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) seedlings by the sandwich method. In the third experiment, we examined the effects of SC remnants combined with adsorbents on lettuce growth parameters. Our results showed that the allelopathic effects of aqueous and methanolic extracts of SC remnant were significantly superior to those of 9-year-old SFS. The aqueous extract of SC remnant reduced the root length of lettuce by 50%. The use of activated carbon and zeolites significantly decreased the observed allelopathic effect. Moreover, lettuce growth in rhizosphere soil was significantly inhibited by SC remnant and SFS extracts. The allelopathic effects of SC remnants caused a growth imbalance between the shoot and roots. Based on biochemical analyses, using the adsorbents increased the carotenoid content and chlorophyll index of lettuce by 23.33% and 5.25%, respectively. Adsorbents may play a role in treating soils contaminated by allelochemicals. "
MEK1 Inhibitor Combined with Irradiation Reduces Migration of Breast Cancer Cells Including miR-221 and ZEB1 EMT Marker Expression,"The miR-221 expression is dependent on the oncogenic RAS-RAF-MEK pathway activation and influences epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database analysis showed high gene significance for ZEB1 with EMT module analysis and miR-221 overexpression within the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and HER2+ subgroups when compared to luminal A/B subgroups. EMT marker expression analysis after MEK1 (TAK-733) inhibitor treatment and irradiation was combined with miR-221 and ZEB1 expression analysis. The interaction of miR-221 overexpression with irradiation and its influence on migration, proliferation, colony formation and subsequent EMT target activation were investigated. The results revealed that MEK1 inhibitor treatment combined with irradiation could decrease the migratory potential of breast cancer cells including reduction of miR-221 and corresponding downstream ZEB1 (EMT) marker expression. The clonogenic survival assays revealed that miR-221 overexpressing SKBR3 cells were more radioresistant when compared to the control. Remarkably, the effect of miR-221 overexpression on migration in highly proliferative and highly HER2-positive SKBR3 cells remained constant even upon 8 Gy irradiation. Further, in naturally miR-221-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells, the proliferation and migration significantly decrease after miR-221 knockdown. This leads to the assumption that radiation alone is not reducing migration capacity of miR-221-overexpressing cells and that additional factors play an important role in this context. The miR-221/ZEB1 activity is efficiently targeted upon MEK1 inhibitor (TAK-733) treatment and when combined with irradiation treatment, significant reduction in migration of breast cancer cells was shown.

Comparative Technical Process and Product Assessment of Catalytic and Thermal Pyrolysis of Lignocellulosic Biomass,"Availability of sustainable transportation fuels in future hinges on the use of lignocellulosic resources for production of biofuels. The process of biomass pyrolysis can be used to convert solid biomass resources into liquid fuels. In this study, laboratory experiments and process simulations were combined to gain insight into the technical performance of catalytic and thermal pyrolysis processes. Waste pinewood was used as a feedstock for the processes. The pyrolysis took place at 500 C and employs three different catalysts, in the case of the catalytic processes. A process model was developed with Aspen Plus and a wide range of representative components of bio-oil were used to model the properties of the bio-oil blend. The results of the process model calculations show that catalytic pyrolysis process produces bio-oil of superior quality. Different technical process scenarios were explored based on the properties of the bio-oil after separation of water-soluble components, with the intention of producing a blendable or stand-alone product. It was found that—depending on the bio-oil requirements—sufficient hydrogen can be made available from the aqueous fraction to further treat the organic fraction to the desired extent. The resulting organic fractions are suitable candidates for blending with conventional fuels. The analysis results are used to provide guidance for catalyst development. "
Introducing TED Talks as a Pedagogical Resource in Sport Management Education through YouTube and LinkedIn,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the educational sector, pushing it towards teaching–learning methodologies where the online aspect takes on special importance. In this sense, social media are tools that facilitate the creation of meaningful and sustainable learning environments. This study shares an educational experience where TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) Talks are introduced as a pedagogical resource through YouTube and LinkedIn in a sport management course. A total of five TED Talks are viewed and discussed by the students in order to develop their professional profile, assisted by a set of initial questions posed by faculty. To assess the impact of the experience, a new scale is created and then validated. The analyses performed reflected the unidimensional nature of this scale, explaining the 64.36% of the variance, and presenting good psychometric properties ( "
Autism Spectrum Disorder and Childhood Apraxia of Speech: Early Language-Related Hallmarks across Structural MRI Study,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Childhood Apraxia of Speech (CAS) are developmental disorders with distinct diagnostic criteria and different epidemiology. However, a common genetic background as well as overlapping clinical features between ASD and CAS have been recently reported. To date, brain structural language-related abnormalities have been detected in both the conditions, but no study directly compared young children with ASD, CAS and typical development (TD). In the current work, we aim: (i) to test the hypothesis that ASD and CAS display neurostructural differences in comparison with TD through morphometric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-based measures (ASD vs. TD and CAS vs. TD); (ii) to investigate early possible disease-specific brain structural patterns in the two clinical groups (ASD vs. CAS); (iii) to evaluate predictive power of machine-learning (ML) techniques in differentiating the three samples (ASD, CAS, TD). We retrospectively analyzed the T1-weighted brain MRI scans of 68 children (age range: 34–74 months) grouped into three cohorts: (1) 26 children with ASD (mean age  standard deviation: 56  11 months); (2) 24 children with CAS (57  10 months); (3) 18 children with TD (55  13 months). Furthermore, a ML analysis based on a linear-kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM) was performed. All but one brain structures displayed significant higher volumes in both ASD and CAS children than TD peers. Specifically, ASD alterations involved fronto-temporal regions together with basal ganglia and cerebellum, while CAS alterations are more focused and shifted to frontal regions, suggesting a possible speech-related anomalies distribution. Caudate, superior temporal and hippocampus volumes directly distinguished the two conditions in terms of greater values in ASD compared to CAS. The ML analysis identified significant differences in brain features between ASD and TD children, whereas only some trends in the ML classification capability were detected in CAS as compared to TD peers. Similarly, the MRI structural underpinnings of two clinical groups were not significantly different when evaluated with linear-kernel SVM. Our results may represent the first step towards understanding shared and specific neural substrate in ASD and CAS conditions, which subsequently may contribute to early differential diagnosis and tailoring specific early intervention.

A Review on Antistaphylococcal Secondary Metabolites from Basidiomycetes,"Fungi are a rich source of secondary metabolites with several pharmacological activities such as antifungal, antioxidant, antibacterial and anticancer to name a few. Due to the large number of diverse structured chemical compounds they produce, fungi from the phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Muccoromycota have been intensively studied for isolation of bioactive compounds. Basidiomycetes-derived secondary metabolites are known as a promising source of antibacterial compounds with activity against Gram-positive bacteria. The continued emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a major challenge to patient health as it leads to higher morbidity and mortality, higher hospital-stay duration and substantial economic burden in global healthcare sector. One of the key culprits for AMR crisis is Staphylococcus aureus causing community-acquired infections as the pathogen develops resistance towards multiple antibiotics. The recent emergence of community strains of S. aureus harbouring methicillin-resistant (MRSA), vancomycin-intermediate (VISA) and vancomycin-resistant (VRSA) genes associated with increased virulence is challenging. Despite the few significant developments in antibiotic research, successful MRSA therapeutic options are still needed to reduce the use of scanty and expensive second-line treatments. This paper provides an overview of findings from various studies on antibacterial secondary metabolites from basidiomycetes, with a special focus on antistaphylococcal activity. "
Rare Pathogenic Copy Number Variation in the 16p11.2 (BP4–BP5) Region Associated with Neurodevelopmental and Neuropsychiatric Disorders: A Review of the Literature,"Copy number variants (CNVs) play an important role in the genetic underpinnings of neuropsychiatric/neurodevelopmental disorders. The chromosomal region 16p11.2 (BP4–BP5) harbours both deletions and duplications that are associated in carriers with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions as well as several rare disorders including congenital malformation syndromes. The aim of this article is to provide a review of the current knowledge of the diverse neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) associated with 16p11.2 deletions and duplications reported in published cohorts. A literature review was conducted using the PubMed/MEDLINE electronic database limited to papers published in English between 1 January 2010 and 31 July 2020, describing 16p11.2 deletions and duplications carriers’ cohorts. Twelve articles meeting inclusion criteria were reviewed from the 75 articles identified by the search. Of these twelve papers, eight described both deletions and duplications, three described deletions only and one described duplications only. This study highlights the heterogeneity of NDD descriptions of the selected cohorts and inconsistencies concerning accuracy of data reporting. "
Investigation on the Flow Field Entropy Structure of Non-Synchronous Blade Vibration in an Axial Turbocompressor,"In order to explore the inducing factors and mechanism of the non-synchronous vibration, the flow field structure and its formation mechanism in the non-synchronous vibration state of a high speed turbocompressor are discussed in this paper, based on the fluid–structure interaction method. The predicted frequencies fBV (4.4EO), fAR (9.6EO) in the field have a good correspondence with the experimental data, which verify the reliability and accuracy of the numerical method. The results indicate that, under a deviation in the adjustment of inlet guide vane (IGV), the disturbances of pressure in the tip diffuse upstream and downstream, and maintain the corresponding relationship with the non-synchronous vibration frequency of the blade. An instability flow that developed at the tip region of 90% span emerged due to interactions among the incoming main flow, the axial separation backflow, and the tip leakage vortices. The separation vortices in the blade passage mixed up with the tip leakage flow reverse at the trailing edge of blade tip, presenting a spiral vortex structure which flows upstream to the leading edge of the adjacent blade. The disturbances of the spiral vortexes emerge to rotate at 54.5% of the rotor speed in the same rotating direction as a modal oscillation. The blade vibration in the turbocompressor is found to be related to the unsteadiness of the tip flow. The large pressure oscillation caused by the movement of the spiral vortex is regarded as the one of the main drivers for the non-synchronous vibration for the present turbocompressor, besides the deviation in the adjustment of IGV.

Regulators at Every Step—How microRNAs Drive Tumor Cell Invasiveness and Metastasis,"Tumor cell invasiveness and metastasis are the main causes of mortality in cancer. Tumor progression is composed of many steps, including primary tumor growth, local invasion, intravasation, survival in the circulation, pre-metastatic niche formation, and metastasis. All these steps are strictly controlled by microRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNA that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. miRNAs can act as oncomiRs that promote tumor cell invasion and metastasis or as tumor suppressor miRNAs that inhibit tumor progression. These miRNAs regulate the actin cytoskeleton, the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) receptors including integrins and ECM-remodeling enzymes comprising matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and regulate epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), hence modulating cell migration and invasiveness. Moreover, miRNAs regulate angiogenesis, the formation of a pre-metastatic niche, and metastasis. Thus, miRNAs are biomarkers of metastases as well as promising targets of therapy. In this review, we comprehensively describe the role of various miRNAs in tumor cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. "
"Influence of a Major Mountainous Landscape Barrier (Mount Cameroon) on the Spread of Metabolic (GSTe2) and Target-Site (Rdl) Resistance Alleles in the African Malaria Vector Anopheles funestus ""2279","Increased levels of insecticide resistance in major malaria vectors such as Anopheles funestus threaten the effectiveness of insecticide-based control programmes. Understanding the landscape features impacting the spread of resistance makers is necessary to design suitable resistance management strategies. Here, we examined the influence of the highest mountain in West Africa (Mount Cameroon; 4095 m elevation) on the spread of metabolic and target-site resistance alleles in An. funestus populations. Vector composition varied across the four localities surveyed along the altitudinal cline with major vectors exhibiting high parity rate (80.5%). Plasmodium infection rates ranged from 0.79% (An. melas) to 4.67% (An. funestus). High frequencies of GSTe2R (67–81%) and RdlR (49–90%) resistance alleles were observed in An. funestus throughout the study area, with GSTe2R frequency increasing with altitude, whereas the opposite is observed for RdlR. Patterns of genetic diversity and population structure analyses revealed high levels of polymorphisms with 12 and 16 haplotypes respectively for GSTe2 and Rdl. However, the reduced diversity patterns of resistance allele carriers revealed signatures of positive selection on the two genes across the study area irrespective of the altitude. Despite slight variations associated with the altitude, the spread of resistance alleles suggest that control strategies could be implemented against malaria vectors across mountainous landscapes. "
Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Analogues of N-Acyl Homoserine Lactones on Eukaryotic Cells,"Background: Since acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) profiling has been described in the gut of healthy subjects and patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the potential effects of these molecules on host cells have raised interest in the medical community. In particular, natural AHLs such as the 3-oxo-C12-HSL exhibit anti-inflammatory properties. Our study aimed at finding stable 3-oxo-C12-HSL-derived analogues with improved anti-inflammatory effects on epithelial and immune cells. Methods: We first studied the stability and biological properties of the natural 3-oxo-C12-HSL on eukaryotic cells and a bacterial reporter strain. We then constructed and screened a library of 22 AHL-derived molecules. Anti-inflammatory effects were assessed by cytokine release in an epithelial cell model, Caco-2, and a murine macrophage cell line, RAW264.7, (respectively, IL-8 and IL-6) upon exposure to the molecule and after appropriate stimulation (respectively, TNF- 50 ng/mL and IFN- 50 ng/mL, and LPS 10 ng/mL and IFN- 20 U/mL). Results: We found two molecules of interest with amplified anti-inflammatory effects on mammalian cells without bacterial-activating properties in the reporter strain. The molecules furthermore showed improved stability in biological medium compared to the native 3-oxo-C12-HSL. Conclusions: We provide new bio-inspired AHL analogues with strong anti-inflammatory properties that will need further study from a therapeutic perspective. "
Novel Insights in Anti-CD38 Therapy Based on CD38-Receptor Expression and Function: The Multiple Myeloma Model,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological disease characterized by the proliferation and accumulation of malignant plasmacells (PCs) in the bone marrow (BM). Despite widespread use of high-dose chemotherapy in combination with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and the introduction of novel agents (immunomodulatory drugs, IMiDs, and proteasome inhibitors, PIs), the prognosis of MM patients is still poor. CD38 is a multifunctional cell-surface glycoprotein with receptor and ectoenzymatic activities. The very high and homogeneous expression of CD38 on myeloma PCs makes it an attractive target for novel therapeutic strategies. Several anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies have been, or are being, developed for the treatment of MM, including daratumumab and isatuximab. Here we provide an in-depth look at CD38 biology, the role of CD38 in MM progression and its complex interactions with the BM microenvironment, the importance of anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies, and the main mechanisms of antibody resistance. We then review a number of multiparametric flow cytometry techniques exploiting CD38 antigen expression on PCs to diagnose and monitor the response to treatment in MM patients. "
Sustainability Accounting—Cognitive and Conceptual Approach,"Nowadays, the speed of changes in practical activities and scientific research in the field of sustainable development has not yet allowed to clearly indicate the role of accounting in this area. Therefore, the main goal of the paper is to present sustainability accounting in the light of positive and normative accounting theory and to propose its conceptual framework as a normative solution. Positive theories allow the author to use inductive reasoning and thus indicates the state of accounting development (opportunities and risks) in sustainable business, identifying three key gaps: theoretical, empirical and methodical. In turn, by means of normative theories, on the basis of deductive reasoning, the paper recognizes the desired directions and normatives of sustainability accounting changes. The research methodology is based on theoretical and methodological triangulation, using descriptive and comparative analysis. The main findings of the research focus on an original normative solution in the form of the author’s concept of sustainability accounting based on conclusions drawn in the light of positive and normative accounting theories. The presented potential research areas are meant to pose the directions of sustainability accounting development. The results of research may determine the future growth, importance and character of sustainability accounting in business, and thus help both shareholders and stakeholders to perceive and use company achievements for sustainable development.

Investigating Paradigm Shift from Price to Value in the Air Cargo Market,"This study presents a paradigm shift in the air cargo market based on Korea and Incheon Airport’s empirical data. The air cargo market has traditionally handled expensive items and has been a supplier-oriented market. There has been little room for individual customers in this market. However, “value” gradually replaces “price” in this market. The value depending on consumer preferences significantly impact air cargo demand. Consequently, items transported by air cargo are changing, and airlines and other market participants are revising operation policy. Economic growth may be losing its dominant power as the main growth engine in the air cargo market. This study identifies the weakened link between air cargo increase and economic growth based on the Granger causality test. COVID-19 calls for a deeper understanding of the paradigm shift in the market for sustainable air transport because COVID-19 will further stimulate it. In this regard, the air cargo business, which maintains a stable trend even during COVID-19, is seen as a new opportunity for the aviation industry. Since sustainable air transport requires an accurate understanding of the paradigm shift in the air cargo market, this study enhances our knowledge of the paradigm shift and provides significant implications for sustainable air transport.

Gold Nanopeanuts as Prospective Support for Cisplatin in Glioblastoma Nano-Chemo-Radiotherapy,"Herein, we propose newly designed and synthesized gold nanopeanuts (Au NPes) as supports for cisplatin (cPt) immobilization, dedicated to combined glioblastoma nano-chemo- radiotherapy. Au NPes offer a large active surface, which can be used for drugs immobilization. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the size of the synthesized Au NPes along the longitudinal axis is ~60 nm, while along the transverse axis ~20 nm. Raman, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DCS) measurements showed, that the created nanosystem is stable up to a temperature of 110 C. MTT assay revealed, that the highest cell mortality was observed for cell lines subjected to nano-chemo-radiotherapy (20–55%). Hence, Au NPes with immobilized cPt (cPt@AuNPes) are a promising nanosystem to improve the therapeutic efficiency of combined nano-chemo-radiotherapy. "
Home Rehabilitation Based on Gamification and Serious Games for Young People: A Systematic Mapping Study,"Physical rehabilitation of people who suffer from some motor disability involves an intensive treatment to reduce pain and improve quality of life. Research studies have proven the benefits of technologies based on home-rehabilitation, which complement regular therapy in hospitals. Although there is a significant number of studies that face this challenge when dealing with adults, it has not been explored with young people. In this research article, we focus on this population, since the repetition of physical exercises decreases the youth's motivation, which entails a high risk of dropping out of therapy. That is why we present a systematic mapping study of the techniques, devices, and methods used to address home rehabilitation for children and teenagers. The conclusions indicate that it is essential to use gamification techniques to adopt a plug-and-play metaphor, based on natural interaction mechanisms and on the use of non-intrusive devices, and to customize the rehabilitation process for each individual along with a methodology. We also present the improvements applied to an existing gamification-based software prototype for home rehabilitation. In this system, physical exercises can be customized, laying the foundations to promote precision rehabilitation within the context of young people. "

PPARs and Myocardial Infarction,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) belong to the nuclear hormone receptor family. They are ligand-activated transcription factors and exist in three different isoforms, PPAR (NR1C1), PPAR/ (NR1C2), and PPAR (NR1C3). PPARs regulate a variety of functions, including glucose and lipid homeostasis, inflammation, and development. They exhibit tissue and cell type-specific expression patterns and functions. Besides the established notion of the therapeutic potential of PPAR agonists for the treatment of glucose and lipid disorders, more recent data propose specific PPAR ligands as potential therapies for cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we focus on the knowledge of PPAR function in myocardial infarction, a severe pathological condition for which therapeutic use of PPAR modulation has been suggested. "
Uranyl Nitrates: By-Products of the Synthetic Experiments or Key Indicators of the Reaction Progress?,"Six novel uranyl nitrate compounds K3[(UO2)(NO3)Cl3](NO3) (1, 2), -Cs2[(UO2)(NO3) Cl3] (3), [(UO2)(NO3)2(H2O)2][(CH3NH3)2(NO3)2] (4), Cs2[(UO2)(NO3)4] (5), and [(UO2)2(OH)2(NO3)2 (H2O)3](H2O) (6) have been prepared from aqueous solutions. Their structures were analyzed using single-crystal X-ray diffraction technique. Structural studies have shown that the crystals of 1 and 2 are isotypic but differ in the distortion at the counter ion’s sites. The crystal of 3 is a low-temperature polymorph modification of the recently studied compound. The crystal structure of 4 is composed of uranyl-dinitrate-dihydrate and methylamine-nitrate electroneutral complexes linked through the system of H-bonds. The crystal structure of 5 is based on the finite [(UO2)(NO3)4]2- clusters that are arranged in pseudo-chained complexes extended along [100] and are arranged according to a hexagonal packing or rods. The crystal of 6 is also a novel polymorph modification of previously studied compound, the structure of which is based on the very rare topological type of the finite clusters. Nowadays, uranyl nitrate finite clusters of nine various topological types are known. We give herein a short review of their topological features and relationships. Crystallization of uranyl nitrates usually occurs when all other competitive anions in the system have already formed crystalline phases, or the reaction of reagents have slowed down or even stopped. Thus it is suggested that crystallization of uranyl nitrates can be used as a key indicator of the reaction progress, which points to the necessity of the initial concentrations of reagents correction, or to the replacement of reagents and adjustment of the thermodynamic (P,T) parameters of the synthesis.

Hormonal Contraceptive Treatment May Reduce the Risk of Fibromyalgia in Women with Dysmenorrhea: A Cohort Study,"Dysmenorrhea is the most common gynecological disorder for women in the reproductive age. Study has indicated that dysmenorrhea might be a general risk factor of chronic pelvic pain and even chronic non-pelvic pain, such as fibromyalgia. We used the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 from the Taiwan National Health Research Institutes Database to investigate whether women with dysmenorrhea have a higher risk of fibromyalgia and whether treatment of dysmenorrhea reduced the risk of fibromyalgia. The dysmenorrhea cohort was matched with a non-dysmenorrhea cohort at a 1:1 ratio based on gender, age, and the year of entry study by frequency matching. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to assess the risk of fibromyalgia, with controlling for potential confounding variables such as age, comorbidities, and medication use. After controlling confounding variables, results revealed that women with dysmenorrhea have a significantly higher risk of fibromyalgia than women without dysmenorrhea. However, only treatment of dysmenorrhea with hormonal contraceptives reduce the risk of fibromyalgia. These results indicated that dysmenorrhea may be a risk factor of fibromyalgia, whereas personalized medicine for treatment of dysmenorrhea may be the key to reduce the risk of fibromyalgia. Future studies are needed to identify the causes and prevention strategies in detail. "
"Current Status of Circulating Tumor Cells, Circulating Tumor DNA, and Exosomes in Breast Cancer Liquid Biopsies","Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Although the five-, ten- and fifteen-year survival rates are good for breast cancer patients diagnosed with early-stage disease, some cancers recur many years after completion of primary therapy. Tumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution may lead to distant metastasis and therapy resistance, which are the main causes of breast cancer-associated deaths. In the clinic today, imaging techniques like mammography and tissue biopsies are used to diagnose breast cancer. Even though these methods are important in primary diagnosis, they have limitations when it comes to longitudinal monitoring of residual disease after treatment, disease progression, therapy responses, and disease recurrence. Over the last few years, there has been an increasing interest in the diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive potential of circulating cancer-derived material acquired through liquid biopsies in breast cancer. Thanks to the development of sensitive devices and platforms, a variety of tumor-derived material, including circulating cancer cells (CTCs), circulating DNA (ctDNA), and biomolecules encapsulated in extracellular vesicles, can now be extracted and analyzed from body fluids. Here we will review the most recent studies on breast cancer, demonstrating the clinical potential and utility of CTCs and ctDNA. We will also review literature illustrating the potential of circulating exosomal RNA and proteins as future biomarkers in breast cancer. Finally, we will discuss some of the advantages and limitations of liquid biopsies and the future perspectives of this field in breast cancer management. "
Association between Exposure to Ambient Air Pollution and Age-Related Cataract: A Nationwide Population-Based Retrospective Cohort Study,"This study aimed to investigate the association between ambient air pollutants and cataracts in the general population aged 50 years or older using data from the Korean National Insurance Service—National Sample Cohort. Cataract patients were defined as those diagnosed by a physician and having undergone cataract surgery. After matching the average concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2, and O3 in residential areas, the association between quartile level of air pollutants and incidence of cataract was analyzed using a multivariate Cox-proportional hazard risk model. Among the 115,728 participants, 16,814 (14.5%) were newly diagnosed with cataract and underwent related surgery between 1 January 2004, and 31 December 2015. Exposure to PM10, NO2, and SO2 was positively associated with cataract incidence, while O3 was negatively associated. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval was 1.069 (1.025–1.115) in PM10 and 1.080 (1.030–1.133) in NO2. However, the association between cataract and the quartile of PM2.5 measured during one year in 2015 was not clear. The HR of female participants aged 65 or older was significantly increased according to quartile of air pollutants. We identified exposure to PM10, NO2, SO2, and O3 associated with cataract development in Korean adults aged  50 years. This information may be helpful for policymaking to control air pollution as a risk factor for eye health. "
Intelligent Tensioning Method for Prestressed Cables Based on Digital Twins and Artificial Intelligence,"In this study, to address the problems of multiple dimensions, large scales, complex tension resource scheduling, and strict quality control requirements in the tensioning process of cables in prestressed steel structures, the technical characteristics of digital twins (DTs) and artificial intelligence (AI) are analyzed. An intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables method driven by the integration of DTs and AI is proposed. Based on the current research status of cable tensioning and DTs, combined with the goal of intelligent tensioning, a fusion mechanism for DTs and AI is established and their integration to drive intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables technology is analyzed. In addition, the key issues involved in the construction of an intelligent control center driven by the integration of DTs and AI are discussed. By considering the construction elements of space and time dimensions, the tensioning process is controlled at multiple levels, thereby realizing the intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables. Driven by intelligent tensioning methods, the safety performance evaluation of the intelligent tensioning process is analyzed. Combined with sensing equipment and intelligent algorithms, a high-fidelity twin model and three-dimensional integrated data model are constructed to realize closed-loop control of the intelligent tensioning safety evaluation. Through the study of digital twins and artificial intelligence fusion to drive the intelligent tensioning method for prestressed cables, this study focuses on the analysis of the intelligent evaluation of safety performance. This study provides a reference for fusion applications with DTs and AI in intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables. "
Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE) and Viral Detection in Polluted Surface Water: A Valuable Tool for COVID-19 Surveillance—A Brief Review,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Disease clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic to severe multiple organ damage. SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a cellular receptor, which is abundantly expressed in the small intestine, allowing viral replication in the gastrointestinal tract. Viral RNA has been detected in the stool of COVID-19 patients and viable viruses had been isolated in some of these samples. Thus, a putative role of SARS-CoV-2 fecal-oral transmission has been argued. SARS-CoV-2 is shed in human excreta and further disposed in the sewerage or in the environment, in poor basic sanitation settings. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a valuable population level approach for monitoring viral pathogens and has been successfully used in different contexts. This review summarizes the current global experience on SARS-CoV-2 WBE in distinct continents and viral detection in polluted surface water. The advantages and concerns of this strategy for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance are discussed. Outcomes suggest that WBE is a valuable early warning alert and a helpful complementary surveillance tool to subside public health response, to tailor containment and mitigation measures and to determine target populations for testing. In poor sanitation settings, contaminated rivers could be alternatively used as a source for environmental surveillance. "
Stereoselective Synthesis of Multisubstituted Cyclohexanes by Reaction of Conjugated Enynones with Malononitrile in the Presence of LDA,"Reaction of linear conjugated enynones, 1,5-diarylpent-2-en-4-yn-1-ones, with malononitrile in the presence of lithium diisopropylamide LDA, as a base, in THF at room temperature for 3–7 h resulted in the formation of the product of dimerization, multisubstituted polyfunctional cyclohexanes, 4-aryl-2,6-bis(arylethynyl)-3-(aryloxomethyl)-4-hydroxycyclohexane-1,1-dicarbonitriles, in yields up to 60%. Varying the reaction conditions by decreasing time and temperature and changing the ratio of starting compounds (enynone and malononitrile) allowed isolating some intermediate compounds, which confirmed a plausible reaction mechanism. The relative stability of possible stereoisomers of such cyclohexanes was estimated by quantum chemical calculations (DFT method). The obtained cyclohexanes were found to possess photoluminescent properties. "

Full Dilatation Caesarean Section and the Risk of Preterm Delivery in a Subsequent Pregnancy: A Historical Cohort Study,"Full dilatation caesarean sections (CS) have increased risk of uterine extensions, which leads to cervical trauma that has been associated with an increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) in a subsequent pregnancy. The aim of this study was to determine if CS at full dilatation increased the risk of sPTB in a subsequent pregnancy in our unit. A historical cohort study was performed on women delivered by emergency CS between 2008–2015 (n "

Bending Behaviour of Polymeric Materials Used on Biomechanics Orthodontic Appliances,"This paper discusses the issues of strength and creep of polymeric materials used in orthodontic appliances. Orthodontic biomechanics is focused on the movement of individual teeth or dental groups as a result of the force applied by orthodontic appliances. Stresses in the construction of functional and biomechanical appliances is generated when using the apparatus in the oral cavity. The orthodontic appliance must maintain its shape and not be damaged during treatment so strength and creep resistance are fundamental properties. It was assumed that the clinical success of orthodontic appliances can be determined by these performance properties. The aim of the work was the experimental assessment of comparative bending strength and creep resistance of selected popular polymer materials used in the production of biomechanical orthodontic appliances. Four commercial materials manufactured by the world class producers were tested: NextDent Ortho Rigid (Vertex-Dental B.V., Soesterberg, The Netherlands) marked as “1A”; Erkocryl (ERKODENT Erich Kopp GmbH, Pfalzgrafenweiler, Germany)-“2A”; Vertex Orthoplast (Vertex Dental B.V.), blue, marked as “3A” and material with the same name as “3A” but orange, marked in the article as “4A”. All the tests were carried out after aging in artificial saliva for 48 h at a temperature of 37 C. Flexular strength and flexular modulus were made using the three point bending method according to the ISO 178 technical standard. Creep tests were carried out according to the method contained in ISO 899-2. The creep test was carried out in an artificial saliva bath at 37 C. The creep tests showed significant differences in the strength, modulus and deformability of the tested materials. The strength reliability of the tested materials also varied. The research shows that the 2A material can be used for orthodontic applications in which long-term stresses should be lower than 20 MPa. "
"Genetic Analysis and Molecular Mapping of the Quantitative Trait Loci Governing Low Phytic Acid Content in a Novel LPA Rice Mutant, PLM11","Breeding rice varieties with a low phytic acid (LPA) content is an effective strategy to overcome micronutrient deficiency in a population which consume rice as a staple food. An LPA mutant, Pusa LPA Mutant 11 (PLM11), was identified from an ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)-induced population of Nagina 22. The present study was carried out to map the loci governing the LPA trait in PLM11 using an F2:3 population derived from a cross between a high phytic acid rice variety, Pusa Basmati 6, with PLM11. The genotyping of the F2 population with 78 polymorphic SSR markers followed by the estimation of phytic acid content in the seeds harvested from 176 F2 plants helped in mapping a major QTL, qLPA8.1, explaining a 22.2% phenotypic variation on Chromosome 8. The QTL was delimited to a 1.96 cM region flanked by the markers RM25 and RM22832. Since there are no previous reports of a QTL/gene governing the LPA content in rice in this region, the QTL qLPA8.1 is a novel QTL. In silico analysis based on the annotated physical map of rice suggested the possible involvement of a locus, Os08g0274775, encoding for a protein similar to a phosphatidylinositol 3- and 4-kinase family member. This needs further validation and fine mapping. Since this QTL is currently specific to PLM11, the linked markers can be utilized for the development of rice varieties with reduced phytic acid (PA) content using PLM11 as the donor, thus enhancing the bioavailability of mineral micronutrients in humans.

Simulation Study on Weld Formation in Full Penetration Laser + MIG Hybrid Welding of Copper Alloy,"Considering the coupling of a droplet, keyhole, and molten pool, a three-dimensional transient model for the full penetration laser + metal inert gas (MIG) hybrid welding of thin copper alloy plate was established, which is able to simulate the temperature and velocity fields, keyhole behavior, and generation of the welding defect. Based on the experimental and simulation results, the weld formation mechanism for the hybrid butt welding of a 2 mm-thick copper alloy plate was comparatively studied in terms of the fluid dynamic feature of the melt pool. For single laser welding, the dynamic behavior of liquid metal near the rear keyhole wall is complex, and the keyhole has a relatively drastic fluctuation. An obvious spattering phenomenon occurs at the workpiece backside. Meanwhile, the underfill (or undercut) defect is formed at both the top and bottom surfaces of the final weld bead, and the recoil pressure is identified as the main factor. In hybrid welding, a downward fluid flow is strengthened on the rear keyhole wall, and the stability of the keyhole root is enhanced greatly. There are large and small clockwise vortexes emerging in the upper and lower parts of the molten pool, respectively. A relatively stable metal bulge can be produced at the weld pool backside. The formation defects are suppressed effectively, increasing the reliability of full penetration butt welding of the thin copper alloy plate. "
Palmprint False Acceptance Attack with a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN),"Biometric-based authentication is widely deployed on multimedia systems currently; however, biometric systems are vulnerable to image-level attacks for impersonation. Reconstruction attack (RA) and presentation attack (PA) are two typical instances for image-level attacks. In RA, the reconstructed images often have insufficient naturalness due to the presence of remarkable counterfeit appearance, thus their forgeries can be easily detected by machine or human. The PA requires genuine users’ original images, which are difficult to acquire in practice and to counterfeit fake biometric images on spoofing carriers. In this paper, we develop false acceptance attack (FAA) for a palmprint biometric, which overcomes the aforementioned problems of RA and PA. FAA does not require genuine users’ images, and it can be launched simply with the synthetic images with high naturalness, which are generated by the generative adversarial networks. As a case study, we demonstrate the feasibility of FAA against coding-based palmprint biometric systems. To further improve the efficiency of FAA, we employ a clustering method to select diverse fake images in order to enhance the diversity of the fake images used, so the number of attack times is reduced. Our experimental results show the success rate and effectiveness of the FAA. "
The Molecular ‘Myc-anisms’ Behind Myc-Driven Tumorigenesis and the Relevant Myc-Directed Therapeutics,"MYC, a well-studied proto-oncogene that is overexpressed in >20% of tumors across all cancers, is classically known as “undruggable” due to its crucial roles in cell processes and its lack of a drug binding pocket. Four decades of research and creativity led to the discovery of a myriad of indirect (and now some direct!) therapeutic strategies targeting Myc. This review explores the various mechanisms in which Myc promotes cancer and highlights five key therapeutic approaches to disrupt Myc, including transcription, Myc-Max dimerization, protein stability, cell cycle regulation, and metabolism, in order to develop more specific Myc-directed therapies.

Regulation of Selenium/Sulfur Interactions to Enhance Chemopreventive Effects: Lessons to Learn from Brassicaceae,"Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element, which represents an integral part of glutathione peroxidase and other selenoproteins involved in the protection of cells against oxidative damage. Selenomethionine (SeMet), selenocysteine (SeCys), and methylselenocysteine (MeSeCys) are the forms of Se that occur in living systems. Se-containing compounds have been found to reduce carcinogenesis of animal models, and dietary supplemental Se might decrease cancer risk. Se is mainly taken up by plant roots in the form of selenate via high-affinity sulfate transporters. Consequently, owing to the chemical similarity between Se and sulfur (S), the availability of S plays a key role in Se accumulation owing to competition effects in absorption, translocation, and assimilation. Moreover, naturally occurring S-containing compounds have proven to exhibit anticancer potential, in addition to other bioactivities. Therefore, it is important to understand the interaction between Se and S, which depends on Se/S ratio in the plant or/and in the growth medium. Brassicaceae (also known as cabbage or mustard family) is an important family of flowering plants that are grown worldwide and have a vital role in agriculture and populations’ health. In this review we discuss the distribution and further interactions between S and Se in Brassicaceae and provide several examples of Se or Se/S biofortifications’ experiments in brassica vegetables that induced the chemopreventive effects of these crops by enhancing the production of Se- or/and S-containing natural compounds. Extensive further research is required to understand Se/S uptake, translocation, and assimilation and to investigate their potential role in producing anticancer drugs. "

"Assessment of the Local Perceptions on the Drivers of Deforestation and Forest Degradation, Agents of Drivers, and Appropriate Activities in Cambodia","Understanding the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation and the agents of such drivers is important for introducing appropriate policy interventions. Here, we identified drivers and agents of drivers through the analysis of local perceptions using questionnaire surveys, focus group discussions, and field observations. The Likert scale technique was employed for designing the questionnaire with scores ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). We found nine direct drivers of forest deforestation and forest degradation, namely illegal logging (4.53  0.60,  is for standard deviation), commercial wood production (4.20  0.71), land clearing for commercial agriculture (4.19  1.15), charcoal production (3.60  1.12), land clearing for subsistence agriculture (3.54  0.75), new settlement and land migration (3.43  0.81), natural disasters (3.31  0.96), human-induced forest fires (3.25  0.96), and fuelwood for domestic consumption (3.21  0.77). We also found four main indirect drivers, namely lack of law enforcement, demand for timber, land tenure right, and population growth. Our analysis indicates that wood furniture makers, medium and large-scale agricultural investors, charcoal makers, land migrants, firewood collectors, and subsistent farmers were the agents of these drivers. Through focus group discussions, 12 activities were agreed upon and could be introduced to reduce these drivers. In addition to enforcing the laws, creating income-generating opportunities for locals along with the provision of environmental education could ensure long-term reduction of these drivers. The REDD+ project could be an option for creating local income opportunities, while reducing deforestation and forest degradation. "

"Antimicrobial, Anticancer and Multidrug-Resistant Reversing Activity of Novel Oxygen-, Sulfur- and Selenoflavones and Bioisosteric Analogues","Multidrug resistance of cancer cells to cytotoxic drugs still remains a major obstacle to the success of chemotherapy in cancer treatment. The development of new drug candidates which may serve as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump inhibitors is a promising strategy. Selenium analogues of natural products, such as flavonoids, offer an interesting motif from the perspective of drug design. Herein, we report the biological evaluation of novel hybrid compounds, bearing both the flavone core (compounds 1–3) or a bioisosteric analogue core (compounds 4–6) and the triflyl functional group against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, yeasts, nematodes, and human colonic adenocarcinoma cells. Results show that these flavones and analogues of flavones inhibited the activity of multidrug resistance (MDR) efflux pump ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein, P-gp). Moreover, the results of the rhodamine 123 accumulation assay demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of the abovementioned efflux pump. Three compounds (4, 5, and 6) exhibited potent inhibitory activity, much stronger than the positive control, verapamil. Thus, these chalcogen bioisosteric analogues of flavones become an interesting class of compounds which could be considered as P-gp efflux pump inhibitors in the therapy of MDR cancer. Moreover, all the compounds served as promising adjuvants in the cancer treatment, since they exhibited the P-gp efflux pump modulating activity. "

Implementation of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry and Peak Analysis: Application to the Discrimination of Cryptococcus neoformans Species Complex and Their Interspecies Hybrids,"Matrix-assisted laser desorption–ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been widely implemented for the rapid identification of microorganisms. Although most bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi can be accurately identified with this method, some closely related species still represent a challenge for MALDI-TOF MS. In this study, two MALDI-TOF-based approaches were applied for discrimination at the species-level of isolates belonging to the Cryptococcus neoformans complex, previously characterized by Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) and sequencing of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region: (i) an expanded database was built with 26 isolates from the main Cryptococcus species found in our setting (C. neoformans, C. deneoformans and AFLP3 interspecies hybrids) and (ii) peak analysis and data modeling were applied to the protein spectra of the analyzed Cryptococcus isolates. The implementation of the in-house database did not allow for the discrimination of the interspecies hybrids. However, the performance of peak analysis with the application of supervised classifiers (partial least squares-discriminant analysis and support vector machine) in a two-step analysis allowed for the 96.95% and 96.55% correct discrimination of C. neoformans from the interspecies hybrids, respectively. In addition, PCA analysis prior to support vector machine (SVM) provided 98.45% correct discrimination of the three analyzed species in a one-step analysis. This novel method is cost-efficient, rapid and user-friendly. The procedure can also be automatized for an optimized implementation in the laboratory routine. "
Tim17 Updates: A Comprehensive Review of an Ancient Mitochondrial Protein Translocator,"The translocases of the mitochondrial outer and inner membranes, the TOM and TIMs, import hundreds of nucleus-encoded proteins into mitochondria. TOM and TIMs are multi-subunit protein complexes that work in cooperation with other complexes to import proteins in different sub-mitochondrial destinations. The overall architecture of these protein complexes is conserved among yeast/fungi, animals, and plants. Recent studies have revealed unique characteristics of this machinery, particularly in the eukaryotic supergroup Excavata. Despite multiple differences, homologues of Tim17, an essential component of one of the TIM complexes and a member of the Tim17/Tim22/Tim23 family, have been found in all eukaryotes. Here, we review the structure and function of Tim17 and Tim17-containing protein complexes in different eukaryotes, and then compare them to the single homologue of this protein found in Trypanosoma brucei, a unicellular parasitic protozoan.

Preparation and Characterization of a Composite Dust Suppressant for Coal Mines,"In an effort to effectively control coal dust pollution and thereby reduce the harm of coal dust to human health, we prepared a highly efficient composite dust suppressant. First, dynamic contact angle and zeta potential measurements were used to select sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) over sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and trisodium methyl silicon as the complementary additive to soy protein isolate for the dust suppressant. We employed viscosity and wind erosion resistance tests to compare the performance of the composite dust suppressant with three common, commercially available suppressants. As the concentration of the composite dust suppressant was increased, the viscosity increased, reaching a maximum value of 22.7 mPas at a concentration of 5 wt%. The 5 wt% concentration of the composite dust suppressant provided the lowest wind erosion rate (20.62%) at a wind speed of 12 m/s. The composite dust suppressant also had good bonding performance and wind erosion resistance. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis were used to characterize the properties of the dust suppressants. The dust suppressant, which had a crystal-like structure, could easily capture coal dust and form an effective package. In addition, the density of the dust suppressant film increased as its crystallinity increased. The increased density was beneficial in that it enabled the dust suppressant to form a hard, solidified shell on the surface of coal dust, which improved dust suppression. The composite dust suppressant also had good thermal stability. "
Nano-Based Theranostic Tools for the Detection and Elimination of Senescent Cells,"The progressive accumulation of apoptosis-resistant and secretory active senescent cells (SCs) in animal and human aged tissues may limit lifespan and healthspan and lead to age-related diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic syndrome. Thus, SCs are suggested targets in anti-aging therapy. In the last two decades, a number of nanomaterials have gained much attention as innovative tools in theranostic applications due to their unique properties improving target visualization, drug and gene delivery, controlled drug release, effective diagnosis, and successful therapy. Although the healthcare industry has focused on a plethora of applications of nanomaterials, it remains elusive how nanomaterials may modulate cellular senescence, a hallmark of aging. In this review paper, we consider novel nanotechnology-based strategies for healthspan promotion and the prevention of age-related dysfunctions that are based on the delivery of therapeutic compounds capable to preferentially killing SCs (nano-senolytics) and/or modulating a proinflammatory secretome (nano-senomorphics/nano-senostatics). Recent examples of SC-targeted nanomaterials and the mechanisms underlying different aspects of the nanomaterial-mediated senolysis are presented and discussed. "

CTLA-4Ig Improves Hyperalgesia in a Mouse Model of Osteoporosis,"This study aimed to evaluate skeletal pain associated with osteoporosis and to examine the inhibitory effects of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4Ig (CTLA-4Ig) administration in ovariectomized (OVX) mice. Eight-week-old female ddY mice were assigned to three groups: sham-operated mice (SHAM) treated with vehicle, OVX mice treated with vehicle (OVX), and OVX mice treated with CTLA-4Ig (CTLA-4Ig). Vehicle or CTLA-4Ig was injected intraperitoneally, starting immediately after surgery. After 4 weeks of treatment, mechanical sensitivity was examined, and the bilateral hind limbs were removed and evaluated by micro-computed tomography, immunohistochemical analyses, and messenger RNA expression analysis. Ovariectomy induced bone loss and mechanical hyperalgesia in the hindlimbs. CTLA-4Ig treatment prevented bone loss in the hindlimbs compared to vehicle administration in the OVX group. Moreover, mechanical hyperalgesia was significantly decreased in the CTLA-4Ig treatment group in comparison to the OVX group. The expression levels of tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) and sclerostin (SOST), as well as the number of osteoclasts, were increased, and the expression level of Wnt-10b was decreased in the OVX group compared with the SHAM group, whereas these parameters were improved in the CTLA-4Ig group compared with the OVX group. The novelty of this research is that CTLA-4Ig administration prevented bone loss and mechanical hyperalgesia induced by ovariectomy in the hindlimbs. "
"Galeon: A Biologically Active Molecule with In Silico Metabolite Prediction, In Vitro Metabolic Profiling in Rat Liver Microsomes, and In Silico Binding Mechanisms with CYP450 Isoforms","Galeon, a natural cyclic-diarylheptanoid (CDH), which was first isolated from Myrica gale L., is known to have potent cytotoxicity against A549 cell lines, anti-tubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, chemo-preventive potential, and moderate topoisomerase inhibitory activity. Here, in silico metabolism and toxicity prediction of galeon by CYP450, in vitro metabolic profiling study in rat liver microsomes (RLMs), and molecular interactions of galeon-CYP450 isoforms were performed. An in silico metabolic prediction study showed demethyl and mono-hydroxy galeon were the metabolites with the highest predictability. Among the predicted metabolites, mono-hydroxy galeon was found to have plausible toxicities such as skin sensitization, thyroid toxicity, chromosome damage, and carcinogenicity. An in vitro metabolism study of galeon, incubated in RLMs, revealed eighteen Phase-I metabolites, nine methoxylamine, and three glutathione conjugates. Identification of possible metabolites and confirmation of their structures were carried out using ion-trap tandem mass spectrometry. In silico docking analysis of galeon demonstrated significant interactions with active site residues of almost all CYP450 isoforms. "
Hypoxia-Mediated Decrease of Ovarian Cancer Cells Reaction to Treatment: Significance for Chemo- and Immunotherapies,"Hypoxia, a common factor ruling the microenvironment composition, leads to tumor progression. In this hypoxic context, cytokines and cells cooperate to favor cancer development and metastasis. Tumor hypoxia is heterogeneously distributed. Oxygen gradients depend on the vicinity, functionality of blood vessels, and oxygen ability to diffuse into surrounding tissues. Thus, the vasculature state modulates the microenvironment of the tumor cells. Cells sense and react to small variations in oxygen tension, which explains the lack of tumor cells’ unicity in their reaction to drugs. Ovarian cancers are highly hypoxia-dependent, ascites worsening the access to oxygen, in their reactions to both chemotherapy and new immunotherapy. Consequently, hypoxia affects the results of immunotherapy, and is thus, crucial for the design of treatments. Controlling key immunosuppressive factors and receptors, as well as immune checkpoint molecule expression on tumor, immune and stromal cells, hypoxia induces immunosuppression. Consequently, new approaches to alleviate hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment bring promises for ovarian cancer immunotherapeutic strategies. This review focuses on the effects of hypoxia in the microenvironment and its consequences on tumor treatments. This opens the way to innovative combined treatments to the advantage of immunotherapy outcome in ovarian cancers. "
Structural Basis of Zika Virus Specific Neutralization in Subsequent Flavivirus Infections,"Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne human flavivirus that causes microcephaly and other neurological disorders, has been a recent focus for the development of flavivirus vaccines and therapeutics. We report here a 4.0 Å resolution structure of the mature ZIKV in complex with ADI-30056, a ZIKV-specific human monoclonal antibody (hMAb) isolated from a ZIKV infected donor with a prior dengue virus infection. The structure shows that the hMAb interactions span across the E protein dimers on the virus surface, inhibiting conformational changes required for the formation of infectious fusogenic trimers similar to the hMAb, ZIKV-117. Structure-based functional analysis, and  structure and sequence comparisons, identified ZIKV residues essential for neutralization and crucial for the evolution of highly potent E protein crosslinking Abs in ZIKV. Thus, this epitope, ZIKV’s “Achilles heel”, defined by the contacts between ZIKV and ADI-30056, could be a suitable target for the design of therapeutic antibodies. "
"The Antinociceptive, Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Effects of 5-Fluoro-2-Oxindole during Inflammatory Pain","Recent studies demonstrate that 5-fluoro-2-oxindole inhibits neuropathic pain but the antinociceptive actions of this drug and its effects on the plasticity, oxidative and inflammatory changes induced by peripheral inflammation as well as on the effects and expression of -opioid receptors (MOR) have not been evaluated. In C57BL/6 male mice with inflammatory pain provoked by the subplantar administration of complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA), we evaluated: (1) the antinociceptive actions of 5-fluoro-2-oxindole and its reversion with the HO-1 inhibitor, tin protoporphyrin IX (SnPP); (2) the effects of 5-fluoro-2-oxindole in the protein levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Nrf2, NADPH quinone oxidoreductase1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), oxidative stress marker (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal; 4-HNE), inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2), microglial markers (CD11b/c and IBA-1), and MOR in the spinal cord and/or paw of animals with inflammatory pain; (3) the antinociceptive effects of morphine in 5-fluoro-2-oxindole pre-treated animals. Treatment with 5 and 10 mg/kg of 5-fluoro-2-oxindole inhibited the allodynia and hyperalgesia induced by CFA in a different, time-dependent manner. These effects were reversed by SnPP. Treatment with 5-fluoro-2-oxindole increased the expression of NQO1, HO-1 and MOR and inhibited the CFA-induced upregulation of phosphorylated MAPK, 4-HNE, NOS2, CD11b/c and IBA-1 in spinal cords and/or paws. The local effects of morphine were improved with 5-fluoro-2-oxindole. This work reveals that 5-fluoro-2-oxindole inhibits the plasticity, oxidative and inflammatory responses provoked by peripheral inflammation and potentiates the antinociceptive effects of morphine. Thus, treatment with 5-fluoro-2-oxindole alone and/or combined with morphine are two remarkable new procedures for chronic inflammatory pain management. "
The Two-Minute Walk Test in Persons withMultiple Sclerosis: Correlations of Cadencewith Free-Living Walking Do Not Support Ecological Validity,"The two-minute walk test (2MWT) is a frequently used walking capacity test in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). However, less is known about its relevance with regards to walking capacity during free-living walking performance. Therefore, the ecological validity of the 2MWT was tested by 1. computing free-living minutes with the same intensity (cadence) as during the 2MWT and 2. investigating the relationship between 2MWT cadence and minutes with the same cadence during free-living walking. 20 pwMS aged 44.2  12.2 (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 3.1  1.4) performed a 2MWT and wore an accelerometer for seven days. The number of pwMS reaching 100%, 90%, 80% or 70% of 2MWT cadence for at least one minute a day and minutes/day with at least 100%, 90%, 80% and 70% of 2MWT cadence during free-living walking was calculated. Six participants reached 100% of the 2MWT cadence for at least one minute/day during free-living walking. A total of 80% 2MWT cadence was the first intensity category that was reached by all participants during free-living walking. No significant correlation was found between cadence in the 2MWT and minutes in which this cadence was reached during free-living walking. Ecological validity with regard to walking intensity could not be confirmed in our study sample. "
Perspectives on the Structural Health Monitoring of Bridges by Synthetic Aperture Radar," Large infrastructures need continuous maintenance because of materials degradation due to atmospheric agents and their persistent use. This problem makes it imperative to carry out persistent monitoring of infrastructure health conditions in order to guarantee maximum safety at all times. The main issue of early warning infrastructure fault detection is that expensive in-situ distributed monitoring sensor networks have to be installed. On the contrary, the use of satellite data has made it possible to use immediate and low-cost techniques in recent years. In this regard, the potential of spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar for the monitoring of critical infrastructures is demonstrated in geographically extended areas, even in the presence of clouds, and in really tough weather. A complete procedure for damage early-warning detection is designed, by using micro-motion (m-m) estimation of critical sites, based on modal proprieties analysis. Particularly, m-m is processed to extract modal features such as natural frequencies and mode shapes generated by vibrations of large infrastructures. Several study cases are here considered and the ``Morandi'' Bridge (Polcevera Viaduct) in Genoa (Italy) is analyzed in depth highlighting abnormal vibration modes during the period before the bridge collapsed.

Plasmonic Hybrids of MoS2 and 10-nm Nanogap Arrays for Photoluminescence Enhancement,"Monolayer MoS2 has attracted tremendous interest, in recent years, due to its novel physical properties and applications in optoelectronic and photonic devices. However, the nature of the atomic-thin thickness of monolayer MoS2 limits its optical absorption and emission, thereby hindering its optoelectronic applications. Hybridizing MoS2 by plasmonic nanostructures is a critical route to enhance its photoluminescence. In this work, the hybrid nanostructure has been proposed by transferring the monolayer MoS2 onto the surface of 10-nm-wide gold nanogap arrays fabricated using the shadow deposition method. By taking advantage of the localized surface plasmon resonance arising in the nanogaps, a photoluminescence enhancement of ~20-fold was achieved through adjusting the length of nanogaps. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of a giant photoluminescence enhancement for this hybrid of MoS2/10-nm nanogap arrays, promising its further applications in photodetectors, sensors, and emitters.

Unveiling Viruses Associated with Gastroenteritis Using a Metagenomics Approach,"Acute infectious gastroenteritis is an important illness worldwide, especially on children, with viruses accounting for approximately 70% of the acute cases. A high number of these cases have an unknown etiological agent and the rise of next generation sequencing technologies has opened new opportunities for viral pathogen detection and discovery. Viral metagenomics in routine clinical settings has the potential to identify unexpected or novel variants of viral pathogens that cause gastroenteritis. In this study, 124 samples from acute gastroenteritis patients from 2012–2014 previously tested negative for common gastroenteritis pathogens were pooled by age and analyzed by next generation sequencing (NGS) to elucidate unidentified viral infections. The most abundant sequences detected potentially associated to acute gastroenteritis were from Astroviridae and Caliciviridae families, with the detection of norovirus GIV and sapoviruses. Lower number of contigs associated to rotaviruses were detected. As expected, other viruses that may be associated to gastroenteritis but also produce persistent infections in the gut were identified including several Picornaviridae members (EV, parechoviruses, cardioviruses) and adenoviruses. According to the sequencing data, astroviruses, sapoviruses and NoV GIV should be added to the list of viral pathogens screened in routine clinical analysis. "
Analytical Modeling of Residual Stress in Laser Powder Bed Fusion Considering Volume Conservation in Plastic Deformation,"Residual stress (RS) is the most challenging problem in metal additive manufacturing (AM) since the build-up of high tensile RS may influence the fatigue life, corrosion resistance, crack initiation, and failure of the additively manufactured components. While tensile RS is inherent in all the AM processes, fast and accurate prediction of the stress state within the part is extremely valuable and results in optimization of the process parameters to achieve a desired RS and control of the build process. This paper proposes a physics-based analytical model to rapidly and accurately predict the RS within the additively manufactured part. In this model, a transient moving point heat source (HS) is utilized to determine the temperature field. Due to the high temperature gradient within the proximity of the melt pool area, the material experiences high thermal stress. Thermal stress is calculated by combining three sources of stresses known as stresses due to the body forces, normal tension, and hydrostatic stress in a homogeneous semi-infinite medium. The thermal stress determines the RS state within the part. Consequently, by taking the thermal stress history as an input, both the in-plane and out of plane RS distributions are found from the incremental plasticity and kinematic hardening behavior of the metal by considering volume conservation in plastic deformation in coupling with the equilibrium and compatibility conditions. In this modeling, material properties are temperature-sensitive since the steep temperature gradient varies the properties significantly. Moreover, the energy needed for the solid-state phase transition is reflected by modifying the specific heat employing the latent heat of fusion. Furthermore, the multi-layer and multi-scan aspects of metal AM are considered by including the temperature history from previous layers and scans. Results from the analytical RS model presented excellent agreement with XRD measurements employed to determine the RS in the Ti-6Al-4V specimens. "
An Analysis Method for Interpretability of CNN Text Classification Model,"With continuous development of artificial intelligence, text classification has gradually changed from a knowledge-based method to a method based on statistics and machine learning. Among them, it is a very important and efficient way to classify text based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Text data are a kind of sequence data, while time sequentiality of the general text data is relatively weak, so text classification is usually less relevant to the sequential structure of the full text. Therefore, CNN-based text classification has gradually become a research hotspot when dealing with issues of text classification. For machine learning, especially deep learning, model interpretability has increasingly become the focus of academic research and industrial applications, and also become a key issue for further development and application of deep learning technology. Therefore, we recommend using the backtracking analysis method to conduct in-depth research on deep learning models. This paper proposes an analysis method for interpretability of a CNN text classification model. The method proposed by us can perform multi-angle analysis on the discriminant results of multi-classified text and multi-label classification tasks through backtracking analysis on model prediction results. Finally, the analysis results of the model can be displayed using visualization technology from multiple dimensions based on interpretability. The representative data set IMDB (Internet Movie Database) in text classification is verified by examples, and the results show that the model can be effectively analyzed when using our method. "
A Hybrid Prediction Model for Energy-Efficient Data Collection in Wireless Sensor Networks,"Energy consumption because of unnecessary data transmission is a significant problem over wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Dealing with this problem leads to increasing the lifetime of any network and improved network feasibility for real time applications. Building on this, energy-efficient data collection is becoming a necessary requirement for WSN applications comprising of low powered sensing devices. In these applications, data clustering and prediction methods that utilize symmetry correlations in the sensor data can be used for reducing the energy consumption of sensor nodes for persistent data collection. In this work, a hybrid model based on decision tree (DT), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and Kalman filtering (KF) methods is proposed to predict the data sampling requirement of sensor nodes to reduce unnecessary data transmission. To perform data sampling predictions in the WSNs efficiently, clustering and data aggregation to each cluster head are utilized, mainly to reduce the processing overheads generating the prediction model. Simulation experiments, comparisons, and performance evaluations conducted in various cases show that the forecasting accuracy of our approach can outperform existing Gaussian and probabilistic based models to provide better energy efficiency due to reducing the number of packet transmissions.

Multiplexed Nanobiosensors: Current Trends in Early Diagnostics,"The ever-growing demand for fast, cheap, and reliable diagnostic tools for personalised medicine is encouraging scientists to improve existing technology platforms and to create new methods for the detection and quantification of biomarkers of clinical significance. Simultaneous detection of multiple analytes allows more accurate assessment of changes in biomarker expression and offers the possibility of disease diagnosis at the earliest stages. The concept of multiplexing, where multiple analytes can be detected in a single sample, can be tackled using several types of nanomaterial-based biosensors. Quantum dots are widely used photoluminescent nanoparticles and represent one of the most frequent choices for different multiplex systems. However, nanoparticles that incorporate gold, silver, and rare earth metals with their unique optical properties are an emerging perspective in the multiplexing field. In this review, we summarise progress in various nanoparticle applications for multiplexed biomarkers. "

"Effects of Nonthermal Plasma on Morphology, Genetics and Physiology of Seeds: A Review","Nonthermal plasma (NTP), or cold plasma, has shown many advantages in the agriculture sector as it enables removal of pesticides and contaminants from the seed surface, increases shelf life of crops, improves germination and resistance to abiotic stress. Recent studies show that plasma treatment indeed offers unique and environmentally friendly processing of different seeds, such as wheat, beans, corn, soybeans, barley, peanuts, rice and Arabidopsis thaliana, which could reduce the use of agricultural chemicals and has a high potential in ecological farming. This review covers the main concepts and underlying principles of plasma treatment techniques and their interaction with seeds. Different plasma generation methods and setups are presented and the influence of plasma treatment on DNA damage, gene expression, enzymatic activity, morphological and chemical changes, germination and resistance to stress, is explained. Important plasma treatment parameters and interactions of plasma species with the seed surface are presented and critically discussed in correlation with recent advances in this field. Although plasma agriculture is a relatively new field of research, and the complex mechanisms of interactions are not fully understood, it holds great promise for the future. This overview aims to present the advantages and limitations of different nonthermal plasma setups and discuss their possible future applications. "

"Protocol of the STRess at Work (STRAW) Project: How to Disentangle Day-to-Day Occupational Stress among Academics Based on EMA, Physiological Data, and Smartphone Sensor and Usage Data","Several studies have reported on increasing psychosocial stress in academia due to work environment risk factors like job insecurity, work-family conflict, research grant applications, and high workload. The STRAW project adds novel aspects to occupational stress research among academic staff by measuring day-to-day stress in their real-world work environments over 15 working days. Work environment risk factors, stress outcomes, health-related behaviors, and work activities were measured repeatedly via an ecological momentary assessment (EMA), specially developed for this project. These results were combined with continuously tracked physiological stress responses using wearable devices and smartphone sensor and usage data. These data provide information on workplace context using our self-developed Android smartphone app. The data were analyzed using two approaches: (1) multilevel statistical modelling for repeated data to analyze relations between work environment risk factors and stress outcomes on a within- and between-person level, based on EMA results and a baseline screening, and (2) machine-learning focusing on building prediction models to develop and evaluate acute stress detection models, based on physiological data and smartphone sensor and usage data. Linking these data collection and analysis approaches enabled us to disentangle and model sources, outcomes, and contexts of occupational stress in academia. "
Drivers of Farm Households’ Perceived Risk Sources and Factors Affecting Uptake of Mitigation Strategies in Punjab Pakistan: Implications for Sustainable Agriculture,"Climate change is a serious threat to agriculture in many developing countries including Pakistan. Changing pattern of climate and its extreme conditions have already led to a decline in crop productivity. However, farmers in developing countries experience risks beyond just climate change, many of which are related to policy, strategy, and factor endowments. The impact of these risks have serious implications for food security, rural livelihood, farm households’ wellbeing, and, above all, their motive to adapt to these changes in the long-term. To have an in-depth knowledge of farmers’ perceptions about the changing climate, this study investigates various aspects such as the determinants of perception about various risk sources and the relevant mitigation and adaptation options. To do so, 480 farmers from agriculture-dominated Punjab province were randomly selected in order for us to evaluate their awareness levels, socioeconomic dynamics that influence their perceptions, and various factors that influence their perceptions to achieve the desired findings. We  applied the principle factor analysis approach to ascertain major sources and strategies based on farmers’ perception and planned/practiced options. Further, regression analysis was done to evaluate the factors influencing the perception levels of farmers about risk sources. The results showed that majority of the farmers faced various risks, and were trying to adapt crop husbandry practices towards these perceived risks. Change in agricultural policies (3.96) was placed as the highest risk source, while the need for small dams/turbine schemes was the top priority for risk management strategy (mean value of 4.39). By observing the effect of farm and farmer’s characteristics on risk sources and risk management strategies, it was revealed that these characteristics ominously provoked farmers’ perspectives about risk sources and management strategies. The findings imply the need for coherent environmental policy that encompasses price stability, community-led adaptation campaigns, and easy/uninterrupted flows of information that enables the farming community to facilitate sustainable decision processes.

Neurosteroids and Focal Epileptic Disorders,"Neurosteroids are a family of compounds that are synthesized in principal excitatory neurons and glial cells, and derive from the transformation of cholesterol into pregnenolone. The most studied neurosteroids—allopregnanolone and allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC)—are known to modulate GABAA receptor-mediated transmission, thus playing a role in controlling neuronal network excitability. Given the role of GABAA signaling in epileptic disorders, neurosteroids have profound effects on seizure generation and play a role in the development of chronic epileptic conditions (i.e., epileptogenesis). We review here studies showing the effects induced by neurosteroids on epileptiform synchronization in in vitro brain slices, on epileptic activity in in vivo models, i.e., in animals that were made epileptic with chemoconvulsant treatment, and in epileptic patients. These studies reveal that neurosteroids can modulate ictogenesis and the occurrence of pathological network activity such as interictal spikes and high-frequency oscillations (80–500 Hz). Moreover, they can delay the onset of spontaneous seizures in animal models of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Overall, this evidence suggests that neurosteroids represent a new target for the treatment of focal epileptic disorders. "
Comparative Toxicological In Vitro and In Ovo Screening of Different Orthodontic Implants Currently Used in Dentistry,"Selecting the most biocompatible orthodontic implant available on the market may be a major challenge, given the wide array of orthodontic devices currently available on the market. The latest scientific data have suggested that in vitro evaluations using oral cell lines provide reliable data regarding the toxicity of residual particles released by different types of orthodontic devices. In this regard, the in vitro biocompatibility of three different commercially available implants (stainless steel and titanium-based implants) was assessed. Methods: As an in vitro model, human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) were employed to evaluate the cellular morphology, cell viability, and cytotoxicity by means of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays at 24 h and 72 h post-exposure to test implants. Results: The results correlate the composition and topography of the implant surface with biological experimental evaluations related to directly affected cells (gingival fibroblasts) and toxicological results on blood vessels (hen’s egg test-chorioallantoic membrane (HET-CAM) assay). The stainless steel implant exhibits a relative cytotoxicity against HGF cells, while the other two samples induced no significant alterations of HGF cells. Conclusion: Among the three test orthodontic implants, the stainless steel implant induced slight cytotoxic effects, thus increased vigilance is required in their clinical use, especially in patients with high sensitivity to nickel.

Clinical and Economic Impact of Third-Generation Cephalosporin-Resistant Infection or Colonization Caused by Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae: A Multicenter Study in China,"Quantifying economic and clinical outcomes for interventions could help to reduce third-generation cephalosporin resistance and Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae. We aimed to compare the differences in clinical and economic burden between third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli (3GCREC) and third-generation cephalosporin-susceptible E. coli (3GCSEC) cases, and between third-generation cephalosporin-resistant K. pneumoniae (3GCRKP) and third-generation cephalosporin-susceptible K. pneumoniae (3GCSKP) cases. A retrospective and multicenter study was conducted. We collected data from electronic medical records for patients who had clinical samples positive for E. coli or K. pneumoniae isolates during 2013 and 2015. Propensity score matching (PSM) was conducted to minimize the impact of potential confounding variables, including age, sex, insurance, number of diagnoses, Charlson comorbidity index, admission to intensive care unit, surgery, and comorbidities. We also repeated the PSM including length of stay (LOS) before culture. The main indicators included economic costs, LOS and hospital mortality. The proportions of 3GCREC and 3GCRKP in the sampled hospitals were 44.3% and 32.5%, respectively. In the two PSM methods, 1804 pairs and 1521 pairs were generated, and 1815 pairs and 1617 pairs were obtained, respectively. Compared with susceptible cases, those with 3GCREC and 3GCRKP were associated with significantly increased total hospital cost and excess LOS. Inpatients with 3GCRKP were significantly associated with higher hospital mortality compared with 3GCSKP cases, however, there was no significant difference between 3GCREC and 3GCSEC cases. Cost reduction and outcome improvement could be achieved through a preventative approach in terms of both antimicrobial stewardship and preventing the transmission of organisms. "
Combining DL-Methionine and Bacillus thuringiensis Subspecies israelensis: Prospects for a Mosquito Larvicide,"Mosquito larvicides can reduce mosquito populations at the source, potentially decreasing biting rates and pathogen transmission. However, there is a growing need for mosquito larvicides that are environmentally sustainable. Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies israelensis (BTI) is a naturally occurring bacterium commonly used as a larvicide to manage mosquito populations. Methionine is an essential amino acid that has demonstrated toxic properties against larval mosquitoes in laboratory experiments, while having minimal effects on non-target organisms. The goal of this study was to evaluate the potential for a novel combination larvicide by testing for compatibility between these two active ingredients. We began by determining the lethal concentration values (LCs) of BTI and DL-methionine against Anopheles quadrimaculatus Say and Aedes aegypti Linnaeus (Diptera: Culicidae) larvae. These bioassays were conducted in glass jars and mortality was observed 48 h post-treatment. We found that while DL-methionine was more toxic to An. quadrimaculatus than Ae. aegypti, the opposite was true for BTI. Then, we used these LCs to conduct bioassays with a combination of BTI and DL-methionine to determine the relationship between the two active ingredients when used against An. quadrimaculatus and Ae. aegypti larvae. The findings of this study demonstrate that BTI and DL-methionine have the potential to be complementary due to their additive properties at higher concentrations and effect levels when tested against An. quadrimaculatus. However, an antagonistic relationship was detected at the concentrations tested with Ae. aegypti. These results are encouraging and imply that a DL-methionine or BTI/DL-methionine combination larvicide could be used in management of Anopheles species. "
"Potential of Bacterial Cellulose Chemisorbed with Anti-Metabolites, 3-Bromopyruvate or Sertraline, to Fight against Helicobacter pylori Lawn Biofilm","Helicobacter pylori is a bacterium known mainly of its ability to cause persistent inflammations of the human stomach, resulting in peptic ulcer diseases and gastric cancers. Continuous exposure of this bacterium to antibiotics has resulted in high detection of multidrug-resistant strains and difficulties in obtaining a therapeutic effect. The purpose of the present study was to determine the usability of bacterial cellulose (BC) chemisorbed with 3-bromopyruvate (3-BP) or sertraline (SER) to act against lawn H. pylori biofilms. The characterization of BC carriers was made using a N2 adsorption/desorption analysis, tensile strength test, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations. Determination of an antimicrobial activity was performed using a modified disk-diffusion method and a self-designed method of testing antibacterial activity against biofilm microbial forms. In addition, bacterial morphology was checked by SEM. It was found that BC disks were characterized by a high cross-linking and shear/stretch resistance. Growth inhibition zones for BC disks chemisorbed with 2 mg of SER or 3-BP were equal to 26.5–27.5 mm and 27–30 mm, respectively. The viability of lawn biofilm H. pylori cells after a 4-h incubation with 2 mg SER or 3-BP chemisorbed on BC disks was 4 log lower, suggesting their antibacterial effect. SEM observations showed a number of morphostructural changes in H. pylori cells exposed to these substances. Concluding, SER and 3-BP chemisorbed on BC carriers presented a promising antibacterial activity against biofilm H. pylori cells in in vitro conditions. "

Natural Product Heme Oxygenase Inducers as Treatment for Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease,"Heme oxygenase (HO) is a critical component of the defense mechanism to a wide variety of cellular stressors. HO induction affords cellular protection through the breakdown of toxic heme into metabolites, helping preserve cellular integrity. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a pathological condition by which the liver accumulates fat. The incidence of NAFLD has reached all-time high levels driven primarily by the obesity epidemic. NALFD can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), advancing further to liver cirrhosis or cancer. NAFLD is also a contributing factor to cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. There are currently no drugs to specifically treat NAFLD, with most treatments focused on lifestyle modifications. One emerging area for NAFLD treatment is the use of dietary supplements such as curcumin, pomegranate seed oil, milk thistle oil, cold-pressed Nigella Satvia oil, and resveratrol, among others. Recent studies have demonstrated that several of these natural dietary supplements attenuate hepatic lipid accumulation and fibrosis in NAFLD animal models. The beneficial actions of several of these compounds are associated with the induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Thus, targeting HO-1 through dietary-supplements may be a useful therapeutic for NAFLD either alone or with lifestyle modifications. "
Cell-free Stem Cell-Derived Extract Formulation for Regenerative Medicine Applications,"Stem cells for regenerative medicine purposes offer therapeutic benefits, but disadvantages are still ill defined. The benefit of stem cells may be attributed to their secretion of growth factors (GFs), cytokines (CKs), and extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. We present a novel cell-free stem cell-derived extract (CCM), formulated from human progenitor endothelial stem cells (hPESCs), characterized for biologically active factors using ELISA, nanoparticle tracking analysis and single particle interferometric reflectance imaging sensing. The effect on fibroblast proliferation and ability to induce stem cell migration was analyzed using Alamar Blue proliferation and Transwell migration assays, respectively. GFs including IGFBP 1, 2, 3, and 6, insulin, growth hormone, PDGF-AA, TGF-, TGF-1, VEGF, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1RA were detected. Membrane enclosed particles within exosome size range and expressing exosome tetraspanins CD81 and CD9 were identified. CCM significantly increased cell proliferation and induced stem cell migration. Analysis of CCM revealed presence of GFs, CKs, and EVs, including exosomes. The presence of multiple factors including exosomes within one formulation, the ability to promote cell proliferation and induce stem cell migration may reduce inflammation and pain, and augment tissue repair.

Cardiovascular Health during and after Cancer Therapy,"Certain cancer treatments have been linked to specific cardiovascular toxicities, including (but not limited to) cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, arterial hypertension, and myocarditis. Radiation, anthracyclines, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2)-directed therapies, fluoropyrimidines, platinums, tyrosine kinase inhibitors and proteasome inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and chimeric antigen-presenting (CAR)-T cell therapy can all cause cardiovascular side effects. Management of cardiovascular dysfunction that occurs during cancer therapy often requires temporary or permanent cessation of the risk-potentiating anti-neoplastic drug as well as optimization of medical management from a cardiovascular standpoint. Stem cell or bone marrow transplant recipients face unique cardiovascular challenges, as do patients at extremes of age. "
Path Following Control for Underactuated Airships with Magnitude and Rate Saturation," This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) based path following strategy for underactuated airships with magnitude and rate saturation. The Markov decision process (MDP) model for the control problem is established. Then an error bounded line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law is investigated to restrain the state space. Subsequently, a proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is employed to approximate the optimal action policy through trial and error. Since the optimal action policy is generated from the action space, the magnitude and rate saturation can be avoided. The simulation results, involving circular, general, broken-line, and anti-wind path following tasks, demonstrate that the proposed control scheme can transfer to new tasks without adaptation, and possesses satisfying real-time performance and robustness.

Aerodynamic and Structural Design of a 2022 Formula One Front Wing Assembly,"The aerodynamic loads generated in a wing are critical in its structural design. When multi-element wings with wingtip devices are selected, it is essential to identify and to quantify their structural behaviour to avoid undesirable deformations which degrade the aerodynamic performance. This research investigates these questions using numerical methods (Computational Fluid Dynamics and Finite Elements Analysis), employing exhaustive validation methods to ensure the accuracy of the results and to assess their uncertainty. Firstly, a thorough investigation of four baseline configurations is carried out, employing Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes equations and the k- SST (Shear Stress Transport) turbulence model to analyse and quantify the most important aerodynamic and structural parameters. Several structural configurations are analysed, including different materials (metal alloys and two designed fibre-reinforced composites). A 2022 front wing is designed based on a bidimensional three-element wing adapted to the 2022 FIA Formula One regulations and its structural components are selected based on a sensitivity analysis of the previous results. The outcome is a high-rigidity-weight wing which satisfies the technical regulations and lies under the maximum deformation established before the analysis. Additionally, the superposition principle is proven to be an excellent method to carry out high-performance structural designs. "
In Vitro and In Vivo Evaluations of -Lactam/-Lactamase Mono- and Combined Therapies against Carbapenem-Nonsusceptible Enterobacteriaceae in Taiwan,"Increasing carbapenem resistance rates worldwide underscored the urgent need of novel antimicrobials. Ceftazidime–avibactam and aztreonam–avibactam combinations are developed to combat carbapenem resistance, but biological and geographic variations must be considered for antibiotic susceptibility patterns varied. Thus, we sought to assess the susceptibilities of ceftazidime–avibactam and aztreonam–avibactam against 660 carbapenem-nonsusceptible Enterobacteriaceae isolates (472 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 188 Escherichia coli) collected during an earlier Taiwan surveillance study. Agar dilution method was used to determine ceftazidime–avibactam and aztreonam–avibactam susceptibility. Metallo-carbapenemase’s contribution to resistance were investigated with EDTA addition. The in vivo efficacies were evaluated using a Caenorhabditis elegans model. High susceptibility rates were observed for ceftazidime–avibactam and aztreonam–avibactam against the 472 carbapenem-nonsusceptible K. pneumoniae (CnsKP) (85.2% and 95.3%, respectively) and 188 carbapenem-nonsusceptible E. coli (CnsEC) isolates (91.5% and 94.1%, respectively). For non-metallo-carbapenemase producers, the susceptibility rates for ceftazidime–avibactam were 93.6% for CnsKP and 97.7% for CnsEC, whereas only 7.1% CnsKP and 11.1% CnsEC in metallo-carbapenemase producers were susceptible to ceftazidime–avibactam. Of all isolates, 95.3% CnsKP and 94.1% CnsEC were susceptible to aztreonam–avibactam. In C. elegans model, ceftazidime–avibactam and aztreonam–avibactam revealed effective against a blaKPC-producing K. pneumoniae isolate in vivo. Our results propose a positive therapeutic approach for both combinations against carbapenem-nonsusceptible Enterobacteriaceae in Taiwan. "
Selective Binding of Cyclodextrins with Leflunomide and Its Pharmacologically Active Metabolite Teriflunomide,"The selectivity of encapsulation of leflunomide and teriflunomide by native -, - and -cyclodextrins was investigated through 1H NMR and molecular modeling. Thermodynamic analysis revealed the main driving forces involved in the binding. For -cyclodextrin, the partial encapsulation was obtained while deep penetration was characterized for the other two cyclodextrins, where the remaining polar fragment of the molecule is located outside the macrocyclic cavity. The interactions via hydrogen bonding are responsible for high negative enthalpy and entropy changes accompanying the complexation of cyclodextrins with teriflunomide. These results were in agreement with the molecular modeling calculations, which provide a clearer picture of the involved interactions at the atomic level. "
PM2.5 Prediction Model Based on Combinational Hammerstein Recurrent Neural Networks,"Airborne particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) can have a profound effect on the health of the population. Many researchers have been reporting highly accurate numerical predictions based on raw PM2.5 data imported directly into deep learning models; however, there is still considerable room for improvement in terms of implementation costs due to heavy computational overhead. From the perspective of environmental science, PM2.5 values in a given location can be attributed to local sources as well as external sources. Local sources tend to have a dramatic short-term impact on PM2.5 values, whereas external sources tend to have more subtle but longer-lasting effects. In the presence of PM2.5 from both sources at the same time, this combination of effects can undermine the predictive accuracy of the model. This paper presents a novel combinational Hammerstein recurrent neural network (CHRNN) to enhance predictive accuracy and overcome the heavy computational and monetary burden imposed by deep learning models. The CHRNN comprises a based-neural network tasked with learning gradual (long-term) fluctuations in conjunction with add-on neural networks to deal with dramatic (short-term) fluctuations. The CHRNN can be coupled with a random forest model to determine the degree to which short-term effects influence long-term outcomes. We also developed novel feature selection and normalization methods to enhance prediction accuracy. Using real-world measurement data of air quality and PM2.5 datasets from Taiwan, the precision of the proposed system in the numerical prediction of PM2.5 levels was comparable to that of state-of-the-art deep learning models, such as deep recurrent neural networks and long short-term memory, despite far lower implementation costs and computational overhead.

The Relationship of the Mechanisms of the Pathogenesis of Multiple Sclerosis and the Expression of Endogenous Retroviruses,"Two human endogenous retroviruses of the HERV-W family can act as cofactors triggering multiple sclerosis (MS): MS-associated retrovirus (MSRV) and ERVWE1. Endogenous retroviral elements are believed to have integrated in our ancestors’ DNA millions of years ago. Their involvement in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including neurodegenerative pathologies, has been demonstrated. Numerous studies have shown a correlation between the deterioration of patients’ health and increased expression of endogenous retroviruses. The exact causes and mechanisms of endogenous retroviruses activation remains unknown, which hampers development of therapeutics. In this review, we will summarize the main characteristics of human endogenous W retroviruses and describe the putative mechanisms of activation, including epigenetic mechanisms, humoral factors as well as the role of the exogenous viral infections.

Development and Study of Nanoemulsions and Nanoemulsion-Based Hydrogels for the Encapsulation of Lipophilic Compounds,"Biocompatible nanoemulsions and nanoemulsion-based hydrogels were formulated for the encapsulation and delivery of vitamin D3 and curcumin. The aforementioned systems were structurally studied applying dynamic light scattering (DLS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and viscometry. In vitro studies were conducted using Franz diffusion cells to investigate the release of the bioactive compounds from the nanocarriers. The cytotoxicity of the nanoemulsions was investigated using the thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell proliferation assay and RPMI 2650 nasal epithelial cells as in vitro model. DLS measurements showed that vitamin D3 and curcumin addition in the dispersed phase of the nanoemulsions caused an increase in the size of the oil droplets from 78.6  0.2 nm to 83.6  0.3 nm and from 78.6  0.2 nm to 165.6  1.0 nm, respectively. Loaded nanoemulsions, in both cases, were stable for 60 days of storage at 25 C. EPR spectroscopy revealed participation of vitamin D3 and curcumin in the surfactants monolayer. In vitro release rates of both lipophilic compounds from the nanoemulsions were comparable to the corresponding ones from the nanoemulsion-based hydrogels. The developed o/w nanoemulsions did not exhibit cytotoxic effect up to the concentration threshold of 1 mg/mL in the cell culture medium. "
"Removal of Arsenate and Arsenite in Equimolar Ferrous and Ferric Sulfate Solutions through Mineral Coprecipitation: Formation of Sulfate Green Rust, Goethite, and Lepidocrocite","An improved understanding of in situ mineralization in the presence of dissolved arsenic and both ferrous and ferric iron is necessary because it is an important geochemical process in the fate and transformation of arsenic and iron in groundwater systems. This work aimed at evaluating mineral phases that could form and the related transformation of arsenic species during coprecipitation. We conducted batch tests to precipitate ferrous (133 mM) and ferric (133 mM) ions in sulfate (533 mM) solutions spiked with As (0–100 mM As(V) or As(III)) and titrated with solid NaOH (400 mM). Goethite and lepidocrocite were formed at 0.5–5 mM As(V) or As(III). Only lepidocrocite formed at 10 mM As(III). Only goethite formed in the absence of added As(V) or As(III). Iron (II, III) hydroxysulfate green rust (sulfate green rust or SGR) was formed at 50 mM As(III) at an equilibrium pH of 6.34. X-ray analysis indicated that amorphous solid products were formed at 10–100 mM As(V) or 100 mM As(III). The batch tests showed that As removal ranged from 98.65–100%. Total arsenic concentrations in the formed solid phases increased with the initial solution arsenic concentrations ranging from 1.85–20.7 g kg-1. Substantial oxidation of initially added As(III) to As(V) occurred, whereas As(V) reduction did not occur. This study demonstrates that concentrations and species of arsenic in the parent solution influence the mineralogy of coprecipitated solid phases, which in turn affects As redox transformations. "
Helicobacter pylori Infection and the Patterns of Gastric Mucin Expression in Children,"Background: The updated model for the mechanism of gastric carcinogenesis demonstrates that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a risk factor in every step of the process. The expression of certain gastric mucins is altered by H. pylori infection in adult patients. The aim of our research was to assess the impact of H. pylori infection on the expression of secretory mucins in the pediatric antral mucosa. Methods: Slides were stained with monoclonal antibodies for MUC5AC, MUC6 and MUC2, digitalized and scored using both a semiquantitative and a quantitative approach. Results: The expression of MUC5AC was significantly lower in infected children. Also, MUC2 expression was more pronounced in infected children. MUC6 expression did not differentiate between infected and noninfected children. Additionally, the presence of chronic inflammation significantly altered the expression of MUC6 and MUC2. The expression of MUC6 was significantly higher in patients with gastric atrophy. Conclusion: The minor differences in mucin expression at distinct ages might stem from different H. pylori exposure periods. Further research is needed to determine the particular patterns of expression according to age and to evaluate the effects of the interaction between H. pylori and mucins in the progression of the gastric carcinogenesis cascade.

Efficacy of Spice Supplementation in Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Systematic Literature Review,"Background: Spices, i.e., curcumin, ginger, saffron, and cinnamon, have a thousand-year history of medicinal use in Asia. Modern medicine has begun to explore their therapeutic properties during the last few decades. We aimed to perform a systematic literature review (SLR) of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of spice supplementation on symptoms and disease activity in patients with chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases (rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondylarthritis, or psoriatic arthritis). Methods: An SLR of RCTs, reviews, and meta-analyses was performed, searching for articles in MEDLINE/PubMed. Abstracts from international rheumatology and nutrition congresses (2017–2020) were also scrutinized. The risk of bias of the selected studies was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool and the Jadad scale. Results: Altogether, six studies, assessing the use of spice supplementation only in RA patients, were included: one on garlic supplementation, two on curcumin, one on ginger, one on cinnamon, and one on saffron supplementation. Garlic, ginger, cinnamon, or saffron supplementation was associated with a decrease in RA clinical activity. However, several points limit the external validity of these studies. No conclusion on the impact of curcumin supplementation on RA activity could be drawn due to low-quality studies. Conclusions: Garlic, ginger, cinnamon, and saffron supplementation could have a beneficial effect on RA activity, but the risk of bias of these studies is difficult to assess and data are too limited to recommend them in daily practice.

"Influence of Dietary Garlic (Allium sativum) and/or Ascorbic Acid on Performance, Feed Utilization, Body Composition and Hemato-Biochemical Parameters of Juvenile Asian Sea Bass (Lates calcarifer)","The current study investigated effects of garlic (Allium sativum) and/or ascorbic acid on growth performance, feed utilization, biochemical body composition, and hemato-biochemical parameters of juvenile Asian sea bass. A total of 600 fish (43.14  0.23 g body weight) were divided into four groups. Fish in the first group were fed basal diet and served as a control group. Fish in groups 2, 3 and 4 were fed a basal diet mixed with garlic (40 g/kg diet), ascorbic acid (1.5 g/kg diet), or garlic (20 g/kg diet)/ascorbic acid (0.75 g/kg diet) mixture, respectively, for 12 weeks. A significant (p < 0.05) increase was observed in growth performance, feed utilization, and chemical body composition in fish fed garlic alone in comparison with the control and other treated groups. All hematological indices, biochemical parameters, and survival rate were not changed significantly (p > 0.05) in all groups throughout the experimental period when compared with the control. Total cholesterol and feed conversion ratio were significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in fish fed garlic alone in comparison to the control and other treated groups. Conclusively, dietary supplementation of garlic alone (40 g/kg diet) was highly effective in improving most of the studied parameters in comparison with that of ascorbic acid alone or a mixture of garlic (20 g/kg diet) and ascorbic acid (0.75 g/kg diet).

Suitability of Biodegradable Materials in Comparison with Conventional Packaging Materials for the Storage of Fresh Pork Products over Extended Shelf-Life Periods,"The packaging of fresh meat has been studied for decades, leading to improved packaging types and conditions such as modified atmosphere packaging (MAP). While commonly used meat packaging uses fossil fuel-based materials, the use of biodegradable packaging materials for this application has not been studied widely. This study aimed at evaluating the sustainability of biodegradable packaging materials compared to established conventional packaging materials through analyses of the quality of freshly packaged pork. The quality was assessed by evaluating sensory aspects, meat color and microbiological attributes of the pork products. The results show no significant differences (p > 0.05) in ground pork and pork loin stored in biodegradable MAP (BioMAP) and conventional MAP for the evaluated sensory attributes, meat color or total bacterial count (TBC) over extended storage times. The data suggest that BioMAP could be a viable alternative to MAP using conventional, fossil fuel-based materials for the storage of fresh meats, while simultaneously fulfilling the customers’ wishes for a more environmentally friendly packaging alternative.

"Analysis of Factors Influencing Food Nutritional Labels Use in Nanjing, China","A correct use of food nutrition la bels benefits consumers in pursuing balanced diets. As a result, we conducted interviews in Nanjing, China and randomly sampled 427 respondents. Further, we used both descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression to assess their perception of food nutrition label use. The results indicated that the current situation is not ideal in Nanjing. Only 7.26% of respondents use labeling consistently. Data on purchasing experience, comprehension, nutritional value, work sector, chronic disease, diet awareness, nutritional knowledge, and age were statistically significant. Conversely, taste and primary shopper categories negatively influenced food nutrition label use. In light of the above results, we propose policy recommendations to promote consumers’ use of food nutrition labels. These are also beneficial in improving diet and relieving chronic diseases. "

Influence of HLA-DQ2.5 Dose on Clinical Picture of Unrelated Celiac Disease Patients,"The clinical phenotype of celiac disease varies considerably among patients and the dosage of HLA-DQ2.5 alleles has been suggested to be a contributing factor. We investigated whether HLA-DQ2.5 allele dosage is associated with distinct clinical parameters at the time of diagnosis and with patients’ response to a gluten-free diet. The final cohort included 605 carefully phenotyped non-related Finnish celiac disease patients grouped as having 0, 1 or 2 copies of HLA-DQ2.5. Clinical data at the time of diagnosis and during gluten-free diet were collected systematically from medical records and supplementary interviews. An increasing HLA-DQ2.5 dose effect was detected for celiac disease antibody positivity at diagnosis (p "
Exercise as an Adjuvant to Cartilage Regeneration Therapy,"This article provides a brief review of the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis and the ontogeny of chondrocytes and details how physical exercise improves the health of osteoarthritic joints and enhances the potential of autologous chondrocyte implants, matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implants, and mesenchymal stem cell implants for the successful treatment of damaged articular cartilage and subchondral bone. In response to exercise, articular chondrocytes increase their production of glycosaminoglycans, bone morphogenic proteins, and anti-inflammatory cytokines and decrease their production of proinflammatory cytokines and matrix-degrading metalloproteinases. These changes are associated with improvements in cartilage organization and reductions in cartilage degeneration. Studies in humans indicate that exercise enhances joint recruitment of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and upregulates their expression of osteogenic and chondrogenic genes, osteogenic microRNAs, and osteogenic growth factors. Rodent experiments demonstrate that exercise enhances the osteogenic potential of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells while diminishing their adipogenic potential, and that exercise done after stem cell implantation may benefit stem cell transplant viability. Physical exercise also exerts a beneficial effect on the skeletal system by decreasing immune cell production of osteoclastogenic cytokines interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-, and interferon-, while increasing their production of antiosteoclastogenic cytokines interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-. In conclusion, physical exercise done both by bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell donors and recipients and by autologous chondrocyte donor recipients may improve the outcome of osteochondral regeneration therapy and improve skeletal health by downregulating osteoclastogenic cytokine production and upregulating antiosteoclastogenic cytokine production by circulating immune cells.

Antioxidant Supplementation Modulates Neutrophil Inflammatory Response to Exercise-Induced Stress,"The aim of the present report was to evaluate the inflammatory response to a 2000-m running test considering neutrophil myeloperoxidase as an inflammatory marker, and to verify if supplements rich in antioxidants could modulate Post-test antioxidant and anti-inflammatory responses. To this end, a 21-day homogenization period was carried out with three groups: a control group, a supplemented group taking an almond beverage enriched with vitamins C and E and a third group consuming the same beverage but enriched with Lippia citriodora extract. At the end of this period, participants performed a 2000-m run, and blood samples were obtained the day before and immediately after the running test. Plasma and neutrophils were isolated. As a result, plasma creatine kinase and myoglobin increased, indicating Post-test muscle damage. Plasma oxidative markers were increased in all groups, except in the group supplemented with the almond beverage. Neutrophil antioxidant enzymes were significantly increased only in the control group, suggesting an antioxidant effect of the supplements provided in the other groups. Myeloperoxidase activity was significantly increased after the test in the control group, while increased enzyme levels were detected in plasma of the supplement groups. Therefore, antioxidant consumption seems to favour myeloperoxidase release. The connection of this observation with post-exercise recovery will require further investigation. "
Fatal Pulmonary Hypertension and Right-Sided Congestive Heart Failure in a Kitten Infected with Aelurostrongylus abstrusus,"Aelurostrongylus abstrusus is considered the most important respiratory nematode of domestic cats worldwide. This parasite inhabits the alveoli, alveolar ducts, and bronchioles and causes a subacute to chronic respiratory clinical disease. Clinical signs may occur in domestic cats of any age, though they are more often described in young animals. Physical examination, echocardiography, thoracic radiography, pulmonary and cardiac pathological findings, classical, and molecular parasitological analysis of a six-month-old kitten referred at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the University of Pisa (Italy) led to a diagnosis of parasitic bronchopneumonia caused by A. abstrusus, which was complicated by severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) and right-sided congestive heart failure (R-CHF) that caused the death of the animal. Cases of reversible PH associated with A. abstrusus infection have been seldom reported in cats. This is the first report of fatal PH and R-CHF in a kitten with clinical aelurostrongylosis. "
Therapeutic Effects of Specialized Pro-Resolving Lipids Mediators on Cardiac Fibrosis via NRF2 Activation,"Heart disease is the number one mortality disease in the world. In particular, cardiac fibrosis is considered as a major factor causing myocardial infarction and heart failure. In particular, oxidative stress is a major cause of heart fibrosis. In order to control such oxidative stress, the importance of nuclear factor erythropoietin 2 related factor 2 (NRF2) has recently been highlighted. In this review, we will discuss the activation of NRF2 by docosahexanoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and the specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) derived from polyunsaturated lipids, including DHA and EPA. Additionally, we will discuss their effects on cardiac fibrosis via NRF2 activation. "
p53 Enhances Artemisia annua L. Polyphenols-Induced Cell Death Through Upregulation of p53-Dependent Targets and Cleavage of PARP1 and Lamin A/C in HCT116 Colorectal Cancer Cells,"Plant-derived natural polyphenols exhibit anticancer activity without showing any noticeable toxicities to normal cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of p53 on the anticancer effect of polyphenols isolated from Korean Artemisia annua L. (pKAL) in HCT116 human colorectal cancer cells. We confirmed that pKAL induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, propidium iodide (PI) uptake, nuclear structure change, and acidic vesicles in a p53-independent manner in p53-null HCT116 cells through fluorescence microscopy analysis of DCF/PI-, DAPI-, and AO-stained cells. The pKAL-induced anticancer effects were found to be significantly higher in p53-wild HCT116 cells than in p53-null by hematoxylin staining, CCK-8 assay, Western blot, and flow cytometric analysis of annexin V/PI-stained cells. In addition, expression of ectopic p53 in p53-null cells was upregulated by pKAL in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, increasing pKAL-induced cell death. Moreover, Western bot analysis revealed that pKAL-induced cell death was associated with upregulation of p53-dependent targets such as p21, Bax and DR5 and cleavage of PARP1 and lamin A/C in p53-wild HCT116 cells, but not in p53-null. Taken together, these results indicate that p53 plays an important role in enhancing the anticancer effects of pKAL by upregulating p53 downstream targets and inducing intracellular cell death processes.

Removal of Different Dye Solutions: A Comparison Study Using a Polyamide NF Membrane,"The removal of organic dyes in aquatic media is, nowadays, a very pressing environmental problem. These dyes usually come from industries, such as textiles, food, and pharmaceuticals, among others, and their harm is produced by preventing the penetration of solar radiation in the aquatic medium, which leads to a great reduction in the process of photosynthesis, therefore damaging the aquatic ecosystems. The feasibility of implementing a process of nanofiltration in the purification treatment of an aqueous stream with small size dyes has been studied. Six dyes were chosen: Acid Brown-83, Allura Red, Basic Fuchsin, Crystal Violet, Methyl Orange and Sunset Yellow, with similar molecular volume (from 250 to 380 Å). The nanofiltration membrane NF99 was selected. Five of these molecules with different sizes, shapes and charges were employed in order to study the behavior of the membrane for two system characteristic parameters: permeate flux and rejection coefficient. Furthermore, a microscopy study and a behavior analysis of the membrane were carried out after using the largest molecule. Finally, the Spiegler–Kedem–Katchalsky model was applied to simulate the behavior of the membrane on the elimination of this group of dyes. "
Guided-Mode Resonance-Based Relative Humidity Sensing Employing a Planar Waveguide Structure,"In this paper, we present a new type of guided-mode resonance (GMR)-based sensor that utilizes a planar waveguide structure (PWS). We employed a PWS with an asymmetric three-layer waveguide structure consisting of substrate/Au/photoresist. The ellipsometric characterization of the structure layers, the simulated reflectance spectra, and optical field distributions under GMR conditions showed that multiple waveguide modes can be excited in the PWS. These modes can be used for refractive index sensing, and the theoretical analysis of the designed PWS showed a sensitivity to the refractive index up to 6600 nm per refractive index unit (RIU) and a figure of merit (FOM) up to 224 RIU-1. In response to these promising theoretical results, the PWS was used to measure the relative humidity (RH) of moist air with a sensitivity up to 0.141 nm/%RH and a FOM reaching 3.7  10-3%RH-1. The results demonstrate that this highly-sensitive and hysteresis-free sensor based on GMR has the potential to be used in a wide range of applications. "
Patient-Related Factors of Medialization Laryngoplasty with Autologous Thyroid Cartilage,"(1) Background: Medialization laryngoplasty with autologous thyroid cartilage (MLATC) is a surgical treatment for glottal closure insufficiency (GCI) resulted from unilateral vocal fold paralysis/paresis (UVFP) and vocal fold atrophy. We aimed to survey the influence of patient-related factors on the outcomes after MLATC. (2) Methods: The study enrolled 35 patients with GCI who underwent MLATC. Patient voice data were recorded before and after MLATC by using multiple acoustic parameters and subjective assessment in a computerized speech laboratory. GCI patients were characterized into subgroups based on three factors: age, 60 vs. <60 years; sex, men vs. women; and BMI, 24 vs. <24. (3) Results: When the subgroups were compared, men did not have better results after surgery than women. Patients ages < 60 years did not exhibit any significantly different outcome compared with those aged  60 years. Patients with BMI  24 did not have any significantly different outcome compared with those with BMI < 24. The subgroups of age, sex, and BMI had no significant difference in cumulative voice recovery and summation of GRBAS (G "
Assessment of the Relationship between Mortality and Troponin I Levels in Hospitalized Patients with the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19),"Background and Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between mortality and cardiac laboratory findings in patients who were hospitalized after a positive PCR for COVID-19 infection. Materials and Methods: This study included patients who were admitted to or referred to the hospital between 20 March and 20 June 2020, diagnosed with COVID-19 via a positive RT-PCR from nasal and pharyngeal swab samples. The troponin I level was measured from each patient. Medical records of patients were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Results: A hundred and five patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and hospitalized, or who died in the hospital due to COVID-19, were included in this study. There was a statistically significant difference between the troponin I high and low level groups in terms of age (years), BMI, shortness of breath (SB), oxygen saturation (%), hypertension, length of stay in the ICU; and for mortality, C-reactive protein, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, D-dimer, creatine kinase-MB, prothrombin time, calcium, and 25-hydroxy vitamin 25(OH)D3 (all p < 0.05). In the logistic analyses, a significant association was noted between troponin I and the adjusted risk of mortality. A ROC curve analysis identified troponin I values > 7.8 pg/mL as an effective cut-off point in mortality for patients with COVID-19. A troponin I value of higher than 7.8 pg/mL yielded a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 86%. Conclusions: The hospital mortality rate was higher among patients diagnosed with COVID-19 accompanied by troponin levels higher than 7.8 pg/mL. Therefore, in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, elevated troponin I levels >7.8 pg/mL can be considered an independent risk factor for mortality. "
Biocompatible SWCNT Conductive Composites for Biomedical Applications,"The efficiency of devices for biomedical applications, including tissue engineering and neuronal stimulation, heavily depends on their biocompatibility and performance level. Therefore, it is important to find adequate materials that meet the necessary requirements such as (i) being intrinsically compatible with biological systems, (ii) providing a sufficient electronic conductivity that promotes efficient signal transduction, (iii) having “soft” mechanical properties comparable to biological structures, and (iv) being degradable in physiological solution. We have developed organic conducting biocompatible single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) composites based on bovine serum albumin, carboxymethylcellulose, and acrylic polymer and investigated their properties, which are relevant for biomedical applications. This includes -potential measurements, conductivity analyses, and SEM micrographs, the latter providing a local analysis of SWCNT distribution in the base material. We observed the development of the electrical conductivity of the SWCNT composites exposed to 1 mM KCl electrolyte for 40 days, representing a high stability of the samples. The conductivity of samples reaches 1300 S/m for 0.45 wt.% nanotubes. Moreover, we demonstrated the biocompatibility of the composites via cultivating fibroblast cell culture. Finally, we showed that composite coating results in the longer lifespan of cells on the surface. Overall, the SWCNT-based conductive composites might be a promising material for extended biomedical applications. "
Analysing the Driving Forces and Environmental Effects of Urban Expansion by Mapping the Speed and Acceleration of Built-Up Areas in China between 1978 and 2017,"Abundant data sets produced from long-term series of high-resolution remote sensing data have made it possible to explore urban issues across different spatiotemporal scales. Based on a 40-year impervious area data set released by Tsinghua University, a method was developed to map the speed and acceleration of urban built-up areas. With the mapping results of the two indices, we characterised the spatiotemporal dynamics of built-up area expansion and captured different types of expansion. Combined with socioeconomic data, we examined the temporal changes and spatial heterogeneity of driving forces with an ordinary least square (OLS) model and a panel data model, as well as exploring the environmental effects of the expansion. Our results reveal that China has experienced drastic urban expansion over the last four decades. Among all cities, megacities and large cities in eastern China, as well as megacities in central and northeast China have experienced the most dramatic urban expansion. A growing number of cities are categorised as thriving, which means that they have both high expansion speed and acceleration. The overall driving force of urban expansion has significantly increased. More specifically, it was associated with population increase in the early stages; however, since 2000, it has been substantially associated with increases in GDP and fixed asset investments. The major driving factors also differ between regions and urban sizes. Urban expansion is identified as being closely associated with environmental deterioration; thus, speed and acceleration should be included as key indicators in exploring the environmental effects of urban expansion. In summary, the results of the presented case study, based on a data set of China, indicate that speed and acceleration are useful in analysing the driving forces of urban expansion and its environmental effects, and may generate more interest in related research.

Structural Insights into the Heme Pocket and Oligomeric State of Non-Symbiotic Hemoglobins from Arabidopsis thaliana,"Non-symbiotic hemoglobins AHb1 and AHb2 from Arabidopsis thaliana are hexacoordinate heme-proteins that likely have different biological roles, in view of diverse tissue localization, expression pattern, and ligand binding properties. Herein, we expand upon previous biophysical studies on these isoforms, focusing on their oligomeric states and circular dichroism (CD) characteristics. We found that AHb1 exists in solution in a concentration-dependent monomer-dimer equilibrium, while AHb2 is present only as a monomer. The quaternary structure of AHb1 affects its degree of hexacoordination with the formation of the dimer that enhances pentacoordination. Accordingly, the mutant of a conserved residue within the dimeric interface, AHb1-T45A, which is mostly monomeric in solution, has an equilibrium that is shifted toward a hexacoordinate form compared to the wild-type protein. CD studies further support differences in the globin’s structure and heme moiety. The Soret CD spectra for AHb2 are opposite in sense to those for AHb1, reflecting different patterns of heme-protein side chain contacts in the two proteins. Moreover, the smaller contribution of the heme to the near-UV CD in AHb2 compared to AHb1 suggests a weaker heme-protein association in AHb2. Our data corroborate the structural diversity of AHb1 and AHb2 and confirm the leghemoglobin-like structural properties of AHb2. "
EvoDevo: Past and Future of Continuum and Process Plant Morphology,"Plants and animals are both important for studies in evolutionary developmental biology (EvoDevo). Plant morphology as a valuable discipline of EvoDevo is set for a paradigm shift. Process thinking and the continuum approach in plant morphology allow us to perceive and interpret growing plants as combinations of developmental processes rather than as assemblages of structural units (“organs”) such as roots, stems, leaves, and flowers. These dynamic philosophical perspectives were already favored by botanists and philosophers such as Agnes Arber (1879–1960) and Rolf Sattler (*1936). The acceptance of growing plants as dynamic continua inspires EvoDevo scientists such as developmental geneticists and evolutionary biologists to move towards a more holistic understanding of plants in time and space. This review will appeal to many young scientists in the plant development research fields. It covers a wide range of relevant publications from the past to present. "
RNA-Seq Analysis of Prickled and Prickle-Free Epidermis Provides Insight into the Genetics of Prickle Development in Red Raspberry (Rubus ideaus L.),"Red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) is a globally commercialized specialty crop with growing demand worldwide. The presence of prickles on the stems, petioles and undersides of the leaves complicates both the field management and harvesting of raspberries. An RNA sequencing analysis was used to identify differentially expressed genes in the epidermal tissue of prickled “Caroline” and prickle-free “Joan J.” and their segregating progeny. Expression patterns of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in prickle-free plants revealed the downregulation of some vital development-related transcription factors (TFs), including a MIXTA-like R2R3-MYB family member; MADS-box; APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSIVE FACTOR (AP2/ERF) and NAM, ATAF1/2 and CUC2 (NAC) in prickle-free epidermis tissue. The downregulation of these TFs was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis, indicating a key regulatory role in prickle development. This study adds to the understanding of prickle development mechanisms in red raspberries needed for utilizing genetic engineering strategies for developing prickle-free raspberry cultivars and, possibly, other Rubus species, such as blackberry (Rubus sp.) and black raspberry (R. occidentalis L.).

Marine Bacteria Display Different Escape Mechanisms When Facing Their Protozoan Predators,"Free-living amoeba are members of microbial communities such as biofilms in terrestrial, fresh, and marine habitats. Although they are known to live in close association with bacteria in many ecosystems such as biofilms, they are considered to be major bacterial predators in many ecosystems. Little is known on the relationship between protozoa and marine bacteria in microbial communities, more precisely on how bacteria are able survive in environmental niches where these bacterial grazers also live. The objective of this work is to study the interaction between the axenized ubiquitous amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii and four marine bacteria isolated from immersed biofilm, in order to evaluate if they would be all grazed upon by amoeba or if they would be able to survive in the presence of their predator. At a low bacteria-to-amoeba ratio, we show that each bacterium is phagocytized and follows a singular intracellular path within this host cell, which appears to delay or to prevent bacterial digestion. In particular, one of the bacteria was found in the amoeba nucleolar compartment whereas another strain was expelled from the amoeba in vesicles. We then looked at the fate of the bacteria grown in a higher bacteria-to-amoeba ratio, as a preformed mono- or multi-species biofilm in the presence of A. castellanii. We show that all biofilms were subjected to detachment from the surface in the presence of the amoeba or its supernatant. Overall, these results show that bacteria, when facing the same predator, exhibit a variety of escape mechanisms at the cellular and population level, when we could have expected a simple bacterial grazing. Therefore, this study unravels new insights into the survival of environmental bacteria when facing predators that they could encounter in the same microbial communities. "
Validation of Numerical Models of a Rotorcraft Crashworthy Seat and Subfloor,"The present work explores some critical aspects of the numerical modeling of a rotorcraft seat and subfloor equipped with energy-absorbing stages, which are paramount in crash landing conditions. To limit the vast complexity of the problem, a purely vertical impact is considered as a reference scenario for an assembly made of a crashworthy helicopter seat and a subfloor section, including an anthropomorphic dummy. A preliminary lumped mass model is used to drive the design of the experimental drop test. Some additional static and dynamic tests are carried out at the coupon and sub-component levels to characterize the seat cushion, the seat pan and the honeycomb elements that were introduced in the structure as energy absorbers. The subfloor section is designed and manufactured with a simplified technique, yet representative of this structural component. Eventually, a finite element model representing the full drop test was created and, together with the original lumped mass model, finally validated against the experimental test, outlining the advantage of using both the numerical techniques for design assistance.

EEG-Based BCI System to Detect Fingers Movements,"The advancement of assistive technologies toward the restoration of the mobility of paralyzed and/or amputated limbs will go a long way. Herein, we propose a system that adopts the brain-computer interface technology to control prosthetic fingers with the use of brain signals. To predict the movements of each finger, complex electroencephalogram (EEG) signal processing algorithms should be applied to remove the outliers, extract features, and be able to handle separately the five human fingers. The proposed method deals with a multi-class classification problem. Our machine learning strategy to solve this problem is built on an ensemble of one-class classifiers, each of which is dedicated to the prediction of the intention to move a specific finger. Regions of the brain that are sensitive to the movements of the fingers are identified and located. The average accuracy of the proposed EEG signal processing chain reached 81% for five subjects. Unlike the majority of existing prototypes that allow only one single finger to be controlled and only one movement to be performed at a time, the system proposed will enable multiple fingers to perform movements simultaneously. Although the proposed system classifies five tasks, the obtained accuracy is too high compared with a binary classification system. The proposed system contributes to the advancement of a novel prosthetic solution that allows people with severe disabilities to perform daily tasks in an easy manner.  "
Zinc Complexes with Nitrogen Donor Ligands as Anticancer Agents,"The search for anticancer metal-based drugs alternative to platinum derivatives could not exclude zinc derivatives due to the importance of this metal for the correct functioning of the human body. Zinc, the second most abundant trace element in the human body, is one of the most important micro-elements essential for human physiology. Its ubiquity in thousands of proteins and enzymes is related to its chemical features, in particular its lack of redox activity and its ability to support different coordination geometries and to promote fast ligands exchange. Analogously to other trace elements, the impairment of its homeostasis can lead to various diseases and in some cases can be also related to cancer development. However, in addition to its physiological role, zinc can have beneficial therapeutic and preventive effects on infectious diseases and, compared to other metal-based drugs, Zn(II) complexes generally exert lower toxicity and offer few side effects. Zinc derivatives have been proposed as antitumor agents and, among the great number of zinc coordination complexes which have been described so far, this review focuses on the design, synthesis and biological studies of zinc complexes comprising N-donor ligands and that have been reported within the last five years.

Within this context, the study, firstly, outlines the meaning of traditional foods in the Romanian consumers’ minds and, secondly, it identifies the variables that can predict the preference for the online purchase of TFs during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey was carried out to investigate the Romanian consumers’ perceptions (n "
An Alternative HIV-1 Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibition Mechanism: Targeting the p51 Subunit,"The ongoing development of drug resistance in HIV continues to push for the need of alternative drug targets in inhibiting HIV. One such target is the Reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme which is unique and critical in the viral life cycle—a rational target that is likely to have less off-target effects in humans. Serendipitously, we found two chemical scaffolds from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Diversity Set V that inhibited HIV-1 RT catalytic activity. Computational structural analyses and subsequent experimental testing demonstrated that one of the two chemical scaffolds binds to a novel location in the HIV-1 RT p51 subunit, interacting with residue Y183, which has no known association with previously reported drug resistance. This finding supports the possibility of a novel druggable site on p51 for a new class of non-nucleoside RT inhibitors that may inhibit HIV-1 RT allosterically. Although inhibitory activity was shown experimentally to only be in the micromolar range, the scaffolds serve as a proof-of-concept of targeting the HIV RT p51 subunit, with the possibility of medical chemistry methods being applied to improve inhibitory activity towards more effective drugs.

Sodium Intake and Heart Failure,"Sodium is an essential mineral and nutrient used in dietary practices across the world and is important to maintain proper blood volume and blood pressure. A high sodium diet is associated with increased expression of —myosin heavy chain, decreased expression of /—myosin heavy chain, increased myocyte enhancer factor 2/nuclear factor of activated T cell transcriptional activity, and increased salt-inducible kinase 1 expression, which leads to alteration in myocardial mechanical performance. A high sodium diet is also associated with alterations in various proteins responsible for calcium homeostasis and myocardial contractility. Excessive sodium intake is associated with the development of a variety of comorbidities including hypertension, chronic kidney disease, stroke, and cardiovascular diseases. While the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Failure Society of America guidelines recommend limiting sodium intake to both prevent and manage heart failure, the evidence behind such recommendations is unclear. Our review article highlights evidence and underlying mechanisms favoring and contradicting limiting sodium intake in heart failure. "
Circulating Tumour DNA Sequencing Identifies a Genetic Resistance-Gap in Colorectal Cancers with Acquired Resistance to EGFR-Antibodies and Chemotherapy,"Epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies (EGFR-Abs) confer a survival benefit in patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), but resistance invariably occurs. Previous data showed that only a minority of cancer cells harboured known genetic resistance drivers when clinical resistance to single-agent EGFR-Abs had evolved, supporting the activity of non-genetic resistance mechanisms. Here, we used error-corrected ctDNA-sequencing (ctDNA-Seq) of 40 cancer genes to identify drivers of resistance and whether a genetic resistance-gap (a lack of detectable genetic resistance mechanisms in a large fraction of the cancer cell population) also occurs in RAS wild-type mCRCs treated with a combination of EGFR-Abs and chemotherapy. We detected one MAP2K1/MEK1 mutation and one ERBB2 amplification in 2/3 patients with primary resistance and KRAS, NRAS, MAP2K1/MEK1 mutations and ERBB2 aberrations in 6/7 patients with acquired resistance. In vitro testing identified MAP2K1/MEK1 P124S as a novel driver of EGFR-Ab resistance. Mutation subclonality analyses confirmed a genetic resistance-gap in mCRCs treated with EGFR-Abs and chemotherapy, with only 13.42% of cancer cells harboring identifiable resistance drivers. Our results support the utility of ctDNA-Seq to guide treatment allocation for patients with resistance and the importance of investigating further non-canonical EGFR-Ab resistance mechanisms, such as microenvironmentally-mediated resistance. The detection of MAP2K1 mutations could inform trials of MEK-inhibitors in these tumours. "
The Role of Soluble Uric Acid in Modulating Autophagy Flux and Inflammasome Activation during Bacterial Infection in Macrophages,"Autophagy is a homeostatic process that regulates and recycles intracellular structures and is a host defense mechanism that facilitates bacterial clearance. Uric acid in plasma is a major antioxidant but in certain conditions acts as an inflammatory danger signal. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of soluble uric acid on autophagy and the inflammatory responses in macrophages during bacterial infection. Herein, we employed murine RAW264.7 macrophages that express uricase enzyme and human THP-1 cells that are uricase-deficient. Three different strains of Staphylococcus aureus and two different strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae were used to infect macrophages in presence and absence of soluble uric acid. We found that soluble uric acid enhanced autophagy flux in infected macrophages. We observed that IL-1 increased during bacterial infection but decreased when macrophages were co-stimulated with bacteria and uric acid. In contrast to IL-1, soluble uric acid did not affect TNF release and there were no dramatic differences when macrophages were infected with S. aureus or K. pneumoniae. In conclusion, uric acid enhances autophagy flux during bacterial infection, consequently reducing inflammasome activation in macrophages. Understanding the effect of uric acid on the interplay between autophagy and inflammation will facilitate therapeutic design. "

An Eddy Current-Based Structural Health Monitoring Technique for Tracking Bolt Cracking,"Bolted joints are the primary structures for the load transfer of large-scale structures. It is vital to monitor the process of bolt cracking for enduring structural safety. In this paper, a structural health monitoring technique based on the embedding eddy current sensing film has been proposed to quantify the crack parameters of bolt cracking. Two configurations of the sensing film containing one-dimensional circumferential coil array and two-dimensional coil array are designed and verified to have the ability to identify three crack parameters: the crack angle, the crack depth, and the crack location in the axial direction of the bolt. The finite element method has been employed not only to verify the capacity of the sensing film, but also to investigate the interaction between the crack and the eddy current/magnetic field. It has been demonstrated that as the crack propagates, the variations of the induced voltage of the sensing coils are influenced by both eddy current effect and magnetic flux leakage, which play different roles in the different periods of the crack propagation. Experiments have been performed to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the sensing film to quantify three crack parameters in the process of the bolt cracking. "
Antidisturbance Control for AUV Trajectory Tracking Based on Fuzzy Adaptive Extended State Observer,"In this paper, an output-feedback fuzzy adaptive dynamic surface controller (FADSC) based on fuzzy adaptive extended state observer (FAESO) is proposed for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) systems in the presence of external disturbances, parameter uncertainties, measurement noises and actuator faults. The fuzzy logic system is incorporated into both the observers and controllers to improve the adaptability of the entire system. The dynamics of the AUV system is established first, considering the external disturbances and parameter uncertainties. Based on the dynamic models, the ESO, combined with a fuzzy logic system tuning the observer bandwidth, is developed to not only adaptively estimate both system states and the lumped disturbances for the controller, but also reduce the impact of measurement noises. Then, the DSC, together with fuzzy logic system tuning the time constant of the low-pass filter, is designed using estimations from the FAESO for the AUV system. The asymptotic stability of the entire system is analyzed through Lyapunov's direct method in the time domain. Comparative simulations are implemented to verify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method compared with other observers and controllers considering external disturbances, parameter uncertainties and measurement noises and even the actuator faults that are not considered in the design process. The results show that the proposed method outperforms others in terms of tracking accuracy, robustness and energy consumption. "
Antimicrobial and Antioxidant Polyketides from a Deep-Sea-Derived Fungus Aspergillus versicolor SH0105,"Fifteen polyketides, including four new compounds, isoversiol F (1), decumbenone D (2), palitantin B (7), and 1,3-di-O-methyl-norsolorinic acid (8), along with 11 known compounds (3–6 and 9–15), were isolated from the deep-sea-derived fungus Aspergillus versicolor SH0105. Their structures and absolute configurations were determined by comprehensive spectroscopic data, including 1D and 2D NMR, HRESIMS, and ECD calculations, and it is the first time to determine the absolute configuration of known decumbenone A (6). All of these compounds were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against four human pathogenic microbes and five fouling bacterial strains. The results indicated that 3,7-dihydroxy-1,9-dimethyldibenzofuran (14) displayed obvious inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 27154) with the MIC value of 13.7 M. In addition, the antioxidant assays of the isolated compounds revealed that aspermutarubrol/violaceol-I (15) exhibited significant 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity with the IC50 value of 34.1 M, and displayed strong reduction of Fe3+ with the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) value of 9.0 mM under the concentration of 3.1 g/mL, which were more potent than ascorbic acid.

"Trade-Off Relationship of Arable and Ecological Land in Urban Growth When Altering Urban Form: A Case Study of Shenzhen, China","Over the last few decades, rapid urban expansion has spread over a great deal of arable and ecological land, leading to severe social and environmental issues. Although different urban growth scenarios cause varying types of urban forms to emerge, there is currently a lack of empirical studies and other research on these different forms. Therefore, it is important for decision-makers to have an improved understanding of the relationships between arable land and ecological land under different urban form conditions in order to implement sustainable urban development policies. This study utilized a patch-based, multilevel stochastic urban growth model to simulate Shenzhen’s urban growth until 2035. To determine the impacts of urban forms and population density on land use, we established five scenarios to simulate urban expansion and land-use changes at the sub-regional scale. The results revealed the trade-off relationships that emerge when altering the urban forms or population density, which shows that no single policy can conserve arable land and ecological land simultaneously. The results also revealed that sub-regions have distinct responses to alternative urban form scenarios compared with an entire region. Decision-makers and planners should consider the urban form in order to optimize development projects that fit local conditions and achieve more sustainable development. "
Impacts of Milking and Housing Environment on Milk Microbiota,"The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of farming environments on microbiota in raw milk and to assess the relationship among microbes by 16S rRNA sequencing methods. Samples of raw milk, cow trough water, teat dip cup, teat, teat liner, dairy hall air, cowshed air, feces, feed, and bedding from two farms were collected. The two highest abundant bacterial groups of Moraxellaceae and Staphylococcaceae were found in milk and teat liner samples, respectively, at Zhengzhou farm, Henan Province. Moreover, the two highest abundant bacterial groups of Enterobacteriaceae and Moraxellaceae were found in milk and teat dip cup samples, respectively, at Qiqihar farm, Heilongjiang Province. Source Tracker analysis revealed that the teat liner and teat dip cup were the most important contributors of microbes in milk samples at Zhengzhou farm and Qiqihar farm, respectively, which could be attributed to the management level of the farm. Therefore, disinfection and cleaning procedures should be developed to improve the quality of raw milk. "
Evaluation of Feature Selection Techniques in a Multifrequency Large Amplitude Pulse Voltammetric Electronic Tongue ,"An electronic tongue is a device composed of a sensor array that takes advantage of the cross sensitivity property of several sensors to perform classification and quantification in liquid substances. In practice, electronic tongues generate a large amount of information that needs to be correctly analyzed, to define which interactions and features are more relevant to distinguish one substance from another. This work focuses on implementing and validating feature selection methodologies in the liquid classification process of a multifrequency large amplitude pulse voltammetric (MLAPV) electronic tongue. Multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP NN) and support vector machine (SVM) were used as supervised machine learning classifiers. Different feature selection techniques were used, such as Variance filter, ANOVA F-value, Recursive Feature Elimination and model-based selection. Both 5-fold Cross validation and GridSearchCV were used in order to evaluate the performance of the feature selection methodology by testing various configurations and determining the best one. The methodology was validated in an imbalanced MLAPV electronic tongue dataset of 13 different liquid substances, reaching a 93.85% of classification accuracy. "
Transcriptome Dynamics during Black and White Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) Seed Development and Identification of Candidate Genes Associated with Black Pigmentation,"Seed coat color is a crucial agronomic trait in sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) since it is strongly linked to seed oil, proteins, and lignans contents, and also influences consumer preferences. In East Asia, black sesame seed is used in the treatment and the prevention of various diseases. However, in sesame, little is known about the establishment of the seed coat color, and only one gene has been reported to control black pigmentation. This study provides an overview of developing seeds transcriptome of two varieties of sesame “Zhongfengzhi No.1” (white seed) and “Zhongzhi No.33” (black seed) and shed light on genes involving in black seed formation. Until eight days post-anthesis (DPA), both the seeds of the two varieties were white. The black sesame seed turned to yellow between 9 and 11 DPA and then black between 12 and 14 DPA. The black and white sesame showed similar trend-expressed genes with the numbers increased at the early stages of seed development. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) number increased with seed development in the two sesame varieties. We examined the DEGs and uncovered that more were up-regulated at the early stages. The DEGs between the black and white sesame were mainly enriched in 37 metabolic pathways, among which the flavonoid biosynthesis and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites were dominants. Furthermore, we identified 20 candidate genes associated with pigment biosynthesis in black sesame seed, among which 10 were flavonoid biosynthesis and regulatory genes. These genes also include isochorismate and polyphenol oxidase genes. By comparing the phenotypes and genes expressions of the black and white sesame seed at different development stages, this work revealed the important role of 8–14 DPA in black pigment biosynthesis and accumulation. Moreover, it unfolded candidate genes associated with black pigmentation in sesame. These findings provide a vast transcriptome dataset and list of genes that will be targeted for functional studies related to the molecular mechanism involved in biosynthesis and regulation of seed coat color in sesame.

Stimuli-Responsive Aliphatic Polycarbonate Nanocarriers for Tumor-Targeted Drug Delivery,"Nanoparticles based on amphiphilic copolymers with tunable physicochemical properties can be used to encapsulate delicate pharmaceutics while at the same time improving their solubility, stability, pharmacokinetic properties, reducing immune surveillance, or achieving tumor-targeting ability. Those nanocarriers based on biodegradable aliphatic polycarbonates are a particularly promising platform for drug delivery due to flexibility in the design and synthesis of appropriate monomers and copolymers. Current studies in this field focus on the design and the synthesis of new effective carriers of hydrophobic drugs and their release in a controlled manner by exogenous or endogenous factors in tumor-specific regions. Reactive groups present in aliphatic carbonate copolymers, undergo a reaction under the action of a stimulus: e.g., acidic hydrolysis, oxidation, reduction, etc. leading to changes in the morphology of nanoparticles. This allows the release of the drug in a highly controlled manner and induces a desired therapeutic outcome without damaging healthy tissues. The presented review summarizes the current advances in chemistry and methods for designing stimuli-responsive nanocarriers based on aliphatic polycarbonates for controlled drug delivery. "
Structural Perspective of Gliadin Peptides Active in Celiac Disease,"Gluten fragments released in gut of celiac individuals activate the innate or adaptive immune systems. The molecular mechanisms associated with the adaptive response involve a series of immunodominant gluten peptides which are mainly recognized by human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2.5 and HLA-DQ8. Other peptides, such as A-gliadin P31–43, are not recognized by HLA and trigger innate responses by several routes not yet well detailed. Among the gluten fragments known to be active in Celiac disease, here we focus on the properties of all gluten peptides with known tri-dimensional structure either those locked into HLA-DQ complexes whose crystals were X-ray analyzed or characterized in solution as free forms. The aim of this work was to find the structural reasons why some gluten peptides prompt the adaptive immune systems while others do not, by apparently involving just the innate immune routes. We propose that P31–43 is a non-adaptive prompter because it is not a good ligand for HLA-DQ. Even sharing a similar ability to adopt polyproline II structure with the adaptive ones, the way in which the proline residues are located along the sequence disfavors a productive P31–43-HLA-DQ binding.

The In-Situ Observation of Grain Rotation and Microstructure Evolution Induced by Electromigration in Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu Solder Joints,"The in-situ observation of Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu solder joints under electromigration was conducted to investigate the microstructure and grain orientation evolution. It was observed that there was a grain rotation phenomenon during current stressing by in-situ electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD). The rotation angle was calculated, which indicated that the grain reorientation led to the decrease of the resistance of solder joints. On the other hand, the orientation of -Sn played a critical role in determining the migration of Cu atoms in solder joints under current stressing migration. When the angle between the electron flow direction and the c-axis of Sn (defined as ) was close to 0, massive Cu6Sn5 intermetallic compounds were observed in the solder bulk; however, when  was close to 90, the migration of the intermetallic compound (IMC) was blocked but many Sn hillocks grew in the anode. Moreover, the low angle boundaries were the fast diffusion channel of Cu atoms while the high grain boundaries in the range of 55–65 were not favorable to the fast diffusion of Cu atoms. "
Binary Black Hole Information Loss Paradox and Future Prospects,"Various techniques to tackle the black hole information paradox have been proposed. A new way out to tackle the paradox is via the use of a pseudo-density operator. This approach has successfully dealt with the problem with a two-qubit entangle system for a single black hole. In this paper, we present the interaction with a binary black hole system by using an arrangement of the three-qubit system of Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) state. We show that our results are in excellent agreement with the theoretical value. We have also studied the interaction between the two black holes by considering the correlation between the qubits in the binary black hole system. The results depict a complete agreement with the proposed model. In addition to the verification, we also propose how modern detection of gravitational waves can be used on our optical setup as an input source, thus bridging the gap with the gravitational wave's observational resources in terms of studying black hole properties with respect to quantum information and entanglement.

Nitrogen Starvation and Stationary Phase Lipophagy Have Distinct Molecular Mechanisms,"In yeast, the selective autophagy of intracellular lipid droplets (LDs) or lipophagy can be induced by either nitrogen (N) starvation or carbon limitation (e.g., in the stationary (S) phase). We developed the yeast, Komagataella phaffii (formerly Pichia pastoris), as a new lipophagy model and compared the N-starvation and S-phase lipophagy in over 30 autophagy-related mutants using the Erg6-GFP processing assay. Surprisingly, two lipophagy pathways had hardly overlapping stringent molecular requirements. While the N-starvation lipophagy strictly depended on the core autophagic machinery (Atg1-Atg9, Atg18, and Vps15), vacuole fusion machinery (Vam7 and Ypt7), and vacuolar proteolysis (proteinases A and B), only Atg6 and proteinases A and B were essential for the S-phase lipophagy. The rest of the proteins were only partially required in the S-phase. Moreover, we isolated the prl1 (for the positive regulator of lipophagy 1) mutant affected in the S-phase lipophagy, but not N-starvation lipophagy. The prl1 defect was at a stage of delivery of the LDs from the cytoplasm to the vacuole, further supporting the mechanistically different nature of the two lipophagy pathways. Taken together, our results suggest that N-starvation and S-phase lipophagy have distinct molecular mechanisms. "
Involvement of Bradykinin Receptor 2 in Nerve Growth Factor Neuroprotective Activity,"Neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF) has been demonstrated to upregulate the gene expression of bradykinin receptor 2 (B2R) on sensory neurons, thus facilitating nociceptive signals. The aim of the present study is to investigate the involvement of B2R in the NGF mechanism of action in nonsensory neurons in vitro by using rat mixed cortical primary cultures (CNs) and mouse hippocampal slices, and in vivo in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) transgenic mice (5xFAD) chronically treated with NGF. A significant NGF-mediated upregulation of B2R was demonstrated by microarray, Western blot, and immunofluorescence analysis in CNs, indicating microglial cells as the target of this modulation. The B2R involvement in the NGF mechanism of action was also demonstrated by using a selective B2R antagonist which was able to reverse the neuroprotective effect of NGF in CNs, as revealed by viability assay, and the NGF-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal slices. To confirm in vitro observations, B2R upregulation was observed in 5xFAD mouse brain following chronic intranasal NGF treatment. This study demonstrates for the first time that B2R is a key element in the neuroprotective activity and synaptic plasticity mediated by NGF in brain cells. "

Salvia officinalis L. from Italy: A Comparative Chemical and Biological Study of Its Essential Oil in the Mediterranean Context,"Salvia officinalis L. (sage) is one of the most appreciated plants for its plethora of biologically active compounds. The objective of our research was a comparative study, in the Mediterranean context, of chemical composition, anticholinesterases, and antioxidant properties of essential oils (EOs) from sage collected in three areas (S1–S3) of Southern Italy. EOs were extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory properties were investigated by employing Ellman’s method. Four in vitro assays, namely, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), ferric-reducing ability power (FRAP), and -carotene bleaching tests, were used to study the antioxidant effects. Camphor (16.16–18.92%), 1,8-cineole (8.80–9.86%), -pinene (3.08–9.14%), camphene (6.27–8.08%), and -thujone (1.17–9.26%) are identified as the most abundant constituents. However, the content of these constituents varied depending on environmental factors and pedoclimatic conditions. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed. Based on Relative Antioxidant Capacity Index (RACI), S2 essential oil exhibited the highest radical potential with an IC50 value of 20.64 g/mL in ABTS test and presented the highest protection of lipid peroxidation with IC50 values of 38.06 and 46.32 g/mL after 30 and 60 min of incubation, respectively. The most promising inhibitory activity against BChE was found for S3 sample (IC50 of 33.13 g/mL). "
"Effects of the Use of Good Agricultural Practices on Aflatoxin Levels in Maize Grown in Nandi County, Kenya","Aflatoxin contaminated maize is of public health concern in Kenya. Training farmers on good agricultural practice (GAP) has been touted as a mitigative measure. Little is known of the effect of such training on aflatoxin levels in maize grown in Kenya. This study evaluated what effect training farmers on GAP has on aflatoxin levels in maize grown in Kaptumo, Kilibwoni, and Kipkaren divisions in Nandi County. Ninety farmers were recruited for the study and interviewed on GAP. Maize samples were additionally collected from the participating farmers and analyzed for aflatoxins using competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA). All farmers prepared the land before planting, applied correct spacing between the planted crops, carried out weeding, cleaned their stores before use, checked the condition of the maize after harvesting, sorted maize after shelling, and knew about aflatoxins. The majority of the farmers (90%) used fertilizers, dried maize after harvesting, knew that aflatoxins were harmful to humans, and used clean transport in transporting the harvested maize. About 98% of farmers did stooking after harvesting and 97% used wooden pallets in the maize stores. The percentage of farmers who practiced early planting, top dressing, crop rotation, raising stores above the ground, applying insecticide after shelling and feeding damaged/rotten seeds to their animals was 84–96%, 62–80%, 67–85%, 86–98%, 63–81%, and 7–21% respectively. About 18/90 (20%) of all farmers reported that they had a relative who had died from liver cancer, and the mean aflatoxin levels in season 1 were significantly different from those in season 2 (1.92  1.07 ppb; 1.30  1.50 ppb). Our findings suggest that although training farmers to adopt good agricultural practices was observed to be efficient in mitigating the problem of aflatoxins, the receptiveness of farmers to different aspects of the training may have differed. Therefore, in designing an optimized regional aflatoxin contamination strategy, local applicability should be considered. "
Quantum Dot–Polyfluorene Composites for White-Light-Emitting Quantum Dot-Based LEDs,"Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are a promising luminescent material for the development of next generation hybrid light-emitting diodes (QDLEDs). In particular, QDs are of great interest in terms of the development of solid-state light sources with an emission spectrum that mimics daylight. In this study, we used CdSe(core)/ZnS/CdS/ZnS(shell) QDs with organic ligands mimicking polyfluorene and its modified derivatives to obtain QD–polymer composites emitting white light. We found that the emission of the composites obtained by spin-coating, being strongly dependent on the chemical structure of the polymer matrix and the QD-to-polymer mass ratio, can be accurately controlled and adjusted to bring its emission spectrum close to the spectrum of daylight (CIE coordinates: 1931 0.307; 0.376). Moreover, the light emission of these composites has been found to be temporally stable, which is due to the minimal structural instability and volume-uniform charge and energy transfer properties. Thus, the use of the synthesized polyfluorene-based organic ligands with controllable chemical structures adaptable to the structure of the polymer matrix can significantly increase the stability of white light emission from QD composites, which can be considered promising electroluminescent materials for fabrication of white QDLEDs.

"Nutrients Recovery during Vermicomposting of Cow Dung, Pig Manure, and Biochar for Agricultural Sustainability with Gases Emissions","An experimental vermicomposting system was established in purple soil present in Sichuan Basin, China. The purpose of vermicomposting (VC) was to recycle and manage organic waste materials; for instance, animal manure and crop residues are present in great quantity. A particular use of earthworms for VC is a valuable method for retrieving essential plant nutrients. Experimental vermicomposting followed by monitoring was conducted for two months in summer with an interval of fifteen days. Four treatments, COM (compost without earthworms), VCM (using cow manure), VPM (through pig manure), and VBC (using biochar), were applied with agricultural wastes such as rapeseed and wheat straw in combination with cow dung, pig manure, and biochar, respectively. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to statistically analyze and interpret the nutrient change among different treatments. Post hoc analysis was done using Tukey’s test. The experimental vermicomposting results revealed that VCM gives increased plant nutrients with a minimum C: N ratio (from 22.13 to 14.38) and a maximum increase in nitrogen concentrations (1.77 to 29.15 g kg-1). A significant decrease in ammonia volatilization was observed in the order VCM > VBC > VPM when compared to COM. It was experimentally established that vermicomposting is the most suitable method for converting organic waste into nutrient-rich fertilizer with the least environmental pollution load. "
Mechanism of Plant Growth Promotion and Disease Suppression by Chitosan Biopolymer,"The chitosan (CHT) biopolymer is a de-acetylated chitin derivative that exists in the outer shell of shrimp, shellfish, lobster or crabs, as well as fungal cell walls. Because of its biodegradability, environmental non-toxicity, and biocompatibility, it is an ideal resource for sustainable agriculture. The CHT emerged as a promising agent used as a plant growth promoter and also as an antimicrobial agent. It induces plant growth by influencing plant physiological processes like nutrient uptake, cell division, cell elongation, enzymatic activation and synthesis of protein that can eventually lead to increased yield. It also acts as a catalyst to inhibit the growth of plant pathogens, and alter plant defense responses by triggering multiple useful metabolic pathways. This review emphasizes the role and mechanisms of CHT as a plant growth promoter and disease suppressor, and its future implications in agriculture. "
Porosity Reducing Processing Stages of Additive Manufactured Molding (AMM) for Closed-Mold Composite Fabrication,"This article aims to merge two evolving technologies, namely additive manufacturing and composite manufacturing, to achieve the production of high-quality and low-cost composite structures utilizing additive manufacturing molding technology. This work studied additive manufacturing processing parameters at various processing stages on final printed part performance, specifically how altering featured wall thickness and layer height combine to affect final porosity. Results showed that reducing the layer height yielded a 90% improvement in pristine porosity reduction. Optimal processing parameters were combined and utilized to design and print a closed additive manufacturing molding tool to demonstrate flexible composite manufacturing by fabricating a composite laminate. Non-destructive and destructive methods were used to analyze the composite structures. Compared to the well-established composite manufacturing processes of hand lay-up and vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding methods, additive manufacturing molding composites were shown to have comparable material strength properties.

Development of Advanced Chemometric-Assisted Spectrophotometric Methods for the Determination of Cromolyn Sodium and Its Alkaline Degradation Products,"Advanced and sensitive spectrophotometric and chemometric analytical methods were successfully established for the stability-indicating assay of cromolyn sodium (CS) and its alkaline degradation products (Deg1 and Deg2). Spectrophotometric mean centering ratio spectra method (MCR) and chemometric methods, including principal component regression (PCR) and partial least square (PLS-2) methods, were applied. Peak amplitudes after MCR at 367.8 nm, 373.8 nm and 310.6 nm were used within linear concentration ranges of 2–40 g mL-1, 5–40 g mL-1 and 10–100 g mL-1 for CS, Deg1 and Deg2, respectively. For PCR and PLS-2 models, a calibration set of eighteen mixtures and a validation set of seven mixtures were built for the simultaneous determination of CS, Deg1 and Deg2 in the ranges of 5–13 g mL-1, 8–16 g mL-1, and 10–30 g mL-1, respectively. The authors emphasize the importance of a stability-indicating strategy for the investigation of pharmaceutical products. "
TXNIP Regulates Natural Killer Cell-Mediated Innate Immunity by Inhibiting IFN- Production during Bacterial Infection,"The function of natural killer (NK) cell-derived interferon- (IFN-) expands to remove pathogens by increasing the ability of innate immune cells. Here, we identified the critical role of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) in the production of IFN- in NK cells during bacterial infection. TXNIP inhibited the production of IFN- and the activation of transforming growth factor -activated kinase 1 (TAK1) activity in primary mouse and human NK cells. TXNIP directly interacted with TAK1 and inhibited TAK1 activity by interfering with the complex formation between TAK1 and TAK1 binding protein 1 (TAB1). Txnip-/- (KO) NK cells enhanced the activation of macrophages by inducing IFN- production during Pam3CSK4 stimulation or Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infection and contributed to expedite the bacterial clearance. Our findings suggest that NK cell-derived IFN- is critical for host defense and that TXNIP plays an important role as an inhibitor of NK cell-mediated macrophage activation by inhibiting the production of IFN- during bacterial infection.

Micellar Carriers Based on Amphiphilic PEG/PCL Graft Copolymers for Delivery of Active Substances,"Amphiphilic copolymers of alkyne functionalized 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (AlHEMA) and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (MPEGMA) with graft or V-shaped graft topologies were synthesized. The functionalization of poly(-caprolactone) (PCL) with azide group enabled attachment to P(AlHEMA-co-MPEGMA) copolymers via a “click” alkyne-azide reaction. The introduction of PCL as a second side chain type in addition to PEG resulted in heterografted copolymers with modified properties such as biodegradability. “Click” reactions were carried out with efficiencies between 17–70% or 32–50% (for lower molecular weight PCL, 4000 g/mol, or higher molecular weight PCL, 9000 g/mol, respectively) depending on the PEG grafting density. The graft copolymers were self-assembled into micellar superstructures with the ability to encapsulate active substances, such as vitamin C (VitC), arbutin (ARB) or 4-n-butylresorcinol (4nBRE). Drug loading contents (DLC) were obtained in the range of 5–55% (VitC), 39–91% (ARB) and 42–98% (4nBRE). In vitro studies carried out in a phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution (at pH 7.4 or 5.5) gave the maximum release levels of active substances after 10–240 min depending on the polymer system. Permeation tests in Franz chambers indicated that the bioactive substances after release by micellar systems penetrated through the artificial skin membrane in small amounts, and a majority of the bioactive substances remained inside the membrane, which is satisfactory for most cosmetic applications.

Tissue-Nonspecific Alkaline Phosphatase— A Gatekeeper of Physiological Conditions in Health and a Modulator of Biological Environments in Disease,"Tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) is a ubiquitously expressed enzyme that is best known for its role during mineralization processes in bones and skeleton. The enzyme metabolizes phosphate compounds like inorganic pyrophosphate and pyridoxal-5’-phosphate to provide, among others, inorganic phosphate for the mineralization and transportable vitamin B6 molecules. Patients with inherited loss of function mutations in the ALPL gene and consequently altered TNAP activity are suffering from the rare metabolic disease hypophosphatasia (HPP). This systemic disease is mainly characterized by impaired bone and dental mineralization but may also be accompanied by neurological symptoms, like anxiety disorders, seizures, and depression. HPP characteristically affects all ages and shows a wide range of clinical symptoms and disease severity, which results in the classification into different clinical subtypes. This review describes the molecular function of TNAP during the mineralization of bones and teeth, further discusses the current knowledge on the enzyme’s role in the nervous system and in sensory perception. An additional focus is set on the molecular role of TNAP in health and on functional observations reported in common laboratory vertebrate disease models, like rodents and zebrafish. "
"Multirate Audio-Integrated Feedback Active Noise Control Systems Using Decimated-Band Adaptive Filters for Reducing Narrowband Noises ""2279","Audio-integrated feedback active noise control (AFANC) systems deliver wideband audio signals and cancel low frequency narrowband noises simultaneously. The conventional AFANC system uses single-rate processing with fullband adaptive active noise control (ANC) filter for generating anti-noise signal and fullband audio cancelation filter for audio-interference cancelation. The conventional system requires a high sampling rate for audio processing. Thus, the fullband adaptive filters require long filter lengths, resulting in high computational complexity and impracticality in real-time system. This paper proposes a multirate AFANC system using decimated-band adaptive filters (DAFs) to decrease the required filter lengths. The decimated-band adaptive ANC filter is updated by the proposed decimated filtered-X least mean square (FXLMS) algorithm, and the decimated-band audio cancelation filter can be obtained by the proposed on-line and off-line decimated secondary-path modeling algorithms. The computational complexity can be decreased significantly in the proposed AFANC system with good enough noise reduction and fast convergence speed, which were verified in the analysis and computer simulations. The proposed AFANC system was implemented for an active headrest system, and the real-time performances were tested in real-time experiments. "
Antibacterial Effect of Aluminum Surfaces Untreated and Treated with a Special Anodizing Based on Titanium Oxide Approved for Food Contact,"One of the main concerns of the food industry is microbial adhesion to food contact surfaces and consequent contamination. We evaluated the potential bacteriostatic/bactericidal efficacy of aluminum surfaces with different large-scale roughness (0.25, 0.5 and 1 m) before and after the surface treatment with a special anodizing based on titanium oxide nanotechnology (DURALTI®) and after 3 different sanitizing treatments, e.g., UV, alcohol and a natural product named Gold lotion. Four Gram-negative (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 1402, Yersinia enterocolitica ATCC 9610 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27588) and four Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 and Listeria monocytogenes NCTT 10888) bacteria were screened. As far as concerns aluminum surfaces without nanotechnology surface treatment, an overall bacteriostatic effect was observed for all strains with respect to the initial inoculum that was 106 CFU/mL. Conversely, an overall bactericidal effect was observed both for Gram-negative and -positive bacteria on DURALTI®-treated aluminum disks, regardless of roughness and sanitizing treatment. These results are innovative in terms of the great potential of the antibacterial activity of nanotechnologically treated food contact surfaces and their combination with some sanitizing agents that might be exploited in the food industry.

Viral Vectors as Gene Therapy Agents for Treatment of Glioblastoma,"In this review, we scrutinize the idea of using viral vectors either as cytotoxic agents or gene delivery tools for treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in light of the experience that our laboratory has accumulated over ~20 years when using similar vectors in experimental neuroscience. We review molecular strategies and current clinical trials and argue that approaches which are based on targeting a specific biochemical pathway or a characteristic mutation are inherently prone to failure because of the high genomic instability and clonal selection characteristics of GBM. For the same reasons, attempts to develop a viral system which selectively transduces only GBM cells are also unlikely to be universally successful. One of the common gene therapy approaches is to use cytotoxic viruses which replicate and cause preferential lysis of the GBM cells. This strategy, in addition to its reliance on the specific biochemical makeup of the GBM cells, bears a risk of necrotic cell death accompanied by release of large quantities of pro-inflammatory molecules. On the other hand, engaging the immune system in the anti-GBM response seems to be a potential avenue to explore further. We suggest that a plausible strategy is to focus on viral vectors which efficiently transduce brain cells via a non-selective, ubiquitous mechanism and which target (ideally irreversibly) processes that are critical only for dividing tumor cells and are dispensable for quiescent brain cells.

Carbon-Based Materials for the Development of Highly Dispersed Metal Catalysts: Towards Highly Performant Catalysts for Fine Chemical Synthesis,"Single-atom catalysts (SACs), consisting of metals atomically dispersed on a support, are considered as advanced materials bridging homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, representing the catalysis at the limit. The enhanced performance of these catalysts is due to the combination of distinct factors such as well-defined active sites, comprising metal single atoms in different coordination environments also varying its valence state and strongly interacting with the support, in this case porous carbons, maximizing then the metal efficiency in comparison with other metal surfaces consisting of metal clusters and/or metal nanoparticles. The purpose of this review is to summarize the most recent advances in terms of both synthetic strategies of producing porous carbon-derived SACs but also its application to green synthesis of highly valuable compounds, an area in which the homogeneous catalysts are classically used. Porous carbon-derived SACs emerge as a type of new and eco-friendly catalysts with great potential. Different types of carbon forms, such as multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), graphene and graphitic carbon nitride or even others porous carbons derived from Metal–Organic-Frameworks (MOFs) are recognized. Although it represents an area of expansion, experimentally and theoretically, much more future efforts are needed to explore them in green fine chemical synthesis. "
Mass Spectrometry-Based Omics for the Characterization of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Bio-Signature,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents an unmet medical need due to a high rate of metastatic occurrence and poor overall survival, pathology aggressiveness, heterogeneous clinical behavior and limited cytotoxic chemotherapy options available because of the absence of targetable receptors. The current standard of care in TNBC is represented by chemotherapy and surgery associated with low overall survival and high relapse rates. Hopes of overcoming current limited and unspecific approaches of TNBC therapy lie in studying the metabolic rewiring of these types of breast cancer, thus understanding the mechanisms involved in the occurrence and progression of the disease. Due to its heterogeneity, a clinically relevant sub-classification of this type of breast cancer based on biomarker panels is greatly needed in order to guide treatment decisions. Mass spectrometry-based omics may provide very useful tools to address the current needs of targetable biomarker discovery and validation. The present review aims to provide a comprehensive view of the current clinical diagnosis and therapy of TNBC highlighting the need for a new approach. Therefore, this paper offers a detailed mass spectrometry-based snapshot of TNBC metabolic adjustment, emphasizing a complex network of variables governing the diverse and aggressive clinical behavior of TNBC.

Starting a Participative Approach to Develop Local Green Infrastructure; from Boundary Concept to Collective Action,"Flanders (Belgium) is one of the most densely populated regions in Europe. Intensive land use, widespread suburbanization, inadequate environmental qualities, and fragmentation everywhere deteriorate living conditions and put pressure on species and natural habitats. In the past, several governmental initiatives were launched to establish a coherent ecological network to improve the situation. Despite the set objectives, only a little progress was made. Therefore, to establish green infrastructure, a new approach that moves away from previous top-down and one-sided strategies is developed. Making use of Green Infrastructure as a boundary concept, interpretation was given through an open and participatory process. The core is the identification of common objectives (ecosystem services or other objectives/services), the selection of appropriate green infrastructure elements to support the services, and the co-design of a network taking the local socio-ecological realm into account. By applying the methodology in concrete urban and rural projects, we learned that establishing strong coalitions of stakeholders, obtaining and sharing reliable knowledge of the systems are key to an effective realization of green infrastructure.

Cellular and Molecular Response of Macrophages THP-1 during Co-Culture with Inactive Trichophyton rubrum Conidia,"Trichophyton rubrum is causing an increasing number of invasive infections, especially in immunocompromised and diabetic patients. The fungal invasive infectious process is complex and has not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms during the interaction of macrophages and T. rubrum. For this purpose, we used a co-culture of previously germinated and heat-inactivated T. rubrum conidia placed in contact with human macrophages cell line THP-1 for 24 h. This interaction led to a higher level of release of interleukins IL-6, IL-2, nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-B) and an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, demonstrating the cellular defense by macrophages against dead fungal elements. Cell viability assays showed that 70% of macrophages remained viable during co-culture. Human microRNA expression is involved in fungal infection and may modulate the immune response. Thus, the macrophage expression profile of microRNAs during co-culture revealed the modulation of 83 microRNAs, with repression of 33 microRNAs and induction of 50 microRNAs. These data were analyzed using bioinformatics analysis programs and the modulation of the expression of some microRNAs was validated by qRT-PCR. In silico analysis showed that the target genes of these microRNAs are related to the inflammatory response, oxidative stress, apoptosis, drug resistance, and cell proliferation. "
Implantation of a Dual-Chamber Automatic Cardioverter Defibrillator in a Patient with Persistent Left Superior Vena Cava: Case Report and Brief Literature Review,"Persistence of the left superior vena cava (PLSVC) is a congenital anomaly reported in 0.3–0.5% of patients. Due to the multiple and complex anatomical variations, transvenous lead placement can become challenging. We report the case of a 47-year-old patient diagnosed with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF—27%), who was referred to our clinic for implantation of a dual-chamber cardioverter defibrillator for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death. During the procedure we encountered an abnormal guidewire trajectory and after venographic examination we established the diagnosis of persistent left superior vena cava. After difficult implantation of a 7F defibrillation lead through the coronary sinus, we managed to place the atrial lead through a narrow brachiocephalic vein into the right atrial appendage. In this paper, we aim to illustrate the medical and technical implications of implanting a cardioverter defibrillator in patients with PLSVC, highlighting the benefit of identifying and utilizing both the innominate vein, and the left superior vena cava and coronary sinus for placement of multiple leads, which would otherwise have been impossible.

Specialised Teachers’ Perceptions on the Management of Aggressive Behaviours in Children and Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders,"This study aimed to explore and describe the perception of specialized teachers regarding the management of aggressive behaviors in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders. Data were collected from 13 specialized teachers working in primary and secondary schools, using focus group interviews, and interview data were analyzed using an open coding method. The analysis of the specialized teachers’ perceptions of the management of aggression in children and adolescents with autism revealed the following results. A central theme “consistent practices to smooth edges” was conceptualized along with the categories: educational responses to individual behaviors, which had sub-themes of “identification of aggressive behavior patterns” and “strategic responses to aggressive behaviors observed”; experience in interventions for aggressive behaviors, with sub-themes of “individual intervention practices” and “school-led therapeutic support” and “factors preventing mitigation of aggression”; and acceptance of virtual reality (VR) based intervention model for aggression, with sub-themes of “acceptance of VR-based program applications” and “proposal for VR-based program contents.” Based on the specialized teachers’ perceptions examined in this study, more effective education and training intervention programs and support systems can be developed and provided for the management of aggressive behaviors in children and adolescents with autism.

Separation of Benzene/Cyclohexane Mixtures by Pervaporation Using Poly (Ethylene-Co-Vinylalcohol) and Carbon Nanotube-Filled Poly (Vinyl Alcohol-Co-Ethylene) Membranes,"Poly(ethylene-co-vinylalcohol) (E-VOH) and carbon nanotube-filled poly (vinyl alcohol-co-ethylene) (E-VOH/CNT) were used as membranes to separate benzene/cyclohexane mixtures by pervaporation technique. To reach this goal, E-VOH and E-VOH/CNT membranes were prepared by solvent casting method and characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetry analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The swelling tests were used to study the mass transfer of the benzene/cyclohexane mixture and their pure components. The separation by pervaporation process was carried out at 25 C in which the effect of CNTs incorporated into E-VOH matrix and the initial concentration of benzene in the feed on the permeate flux, j, and separation factor, , performance was investigated. The results obtained were very promising, in which the integration of CNTs through E-VOH chains increased the absorption area and raised the flux to 740 g/m2h. The separation factor increased to 9.03 and the pervaporation separation reached an index of 5942.2 g/m2h for the azeotropic mixture during 3 h of the separation process. In contrast, for the unfilled E-VOH membrane, it was found that these parameters were a rise of 280 gm-2h-1, separation factor of 12.90 and pervaporation separation index of 3332.0 g/m2h, under the same conditions. Likewise, the calculation of the performance of the E-VOH/CNT membrane with regard to that of the unfilled membrane indicated 2.64 for the total flux and 0.70 for the separation factor. It was also revealed that the best compromise of the filled membrane in terms of total cumulative flux and separation factor is obtained for the feed containing the azeotropic mixture. "
Impact of Enzymatic and Microbial Bioprocessing on Antioxidant Properties of Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.),"Although the hemp seed boasts high nutritional and functional potential, its use in food preparations is still underestimated due to scarce technological properties and the presence of several anti-nutritional factors. Here, an optimization of a biotechnological protocol aimed at improving the antioxidant properties and the protein digestibility of the whole hemp seed has been proposed. Processing based on the use of commercial food grade enzymes and ad hoc selected lactic acid bacteria was tested and the phenolic and protein profiles were investigated through an integrated approach including selective extraction, purification, and identification of the potentially active compounds. The influence of the bioprocessing on the antioxidant activity of the hemp was evaluated both in vitro and on human keratinocytes. The lactic acid bacteria fermentation was the best method to significantly improve the antioxidant potential of the hemp through intense proteolysis which led to both the release of bioactive peptides and the increase in the protein digestibility. Moreover, changes in the phenolic profile allowed a significant protective effect against oxidative stress measured on the human keratinocyte cell line. "
Analysis of Impact of Rain Conditions on ADAS,"Various technologies are being developed to support safe driving. Among them, ADAS, including LDWS, is becoming increasingly common. This driver assistance system aims to create a safe road environment while compensating for the driver’s carelessness. The driver is affected by external environmental factors such as rainfall, snowfall, and bad weather conditions. ADAS is designed to recognize the surrounding situation and enable safe driving by using sensors, but it does not operate normally in bad weather conditions. In this study, we quantitatively measured the effect of bad weather conditions on the actual ADAS function. Additionally, we conducted a vehicle-based driving experiment to suggest an improvement plan for safer driving. In the driving experiment, when the vehicle driving speed was changed in four stages of rainfall, it was confirmed that it affected the View Range value, where the primary variable is the visibility of ADAS. As a result of the analysis, we demonstrated that when the rainfall exceeded a precipitation of 20 mm, the ADAS sensor did not operate, regardless of the vehicle speed. This means that a problem affecting safe driving may occur due to functionality in bad weather situations in which the driver requires ADAS assistance. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a technology that can maintain the minimum ADAS functionality under rainfall conditions and other bad weather conditions. "
Closing the Gaps to Understand the Tick Transmission of Anaplasma marginale among Giant Anteaters (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) in Argentina,"Anaplasma marginale, a well-known cattle pathogen of tropical and subtropical world regions, has been previously molecularly characterized in a giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) from Corrientes, Argentina. Ticks or other hematophagous arthropod involved in the wild transmission cycle remained unknown. The aim of the present study was to analyze the simultaneous occurrence of A. marginale in blood samples and ticks from giant anteaters from Corrientes in order to investigate if ticks could be relevant in the transmission among these mammals. Blood samples from 50 giant anteaters collected in different years and 26 ticks Amblyomma dubitatum and A. sculptum were studied through the molecular amplification of two unequivocal species-specific genes from A. marginale: msp5 and msp1. Twenty five giant anteaters and tick organs (salivary glands, gut and oviduct) from 11 ticks tested positive to the A. marginale DNA amplification. The further molecular characterization through MSP1a tandem repeats analysis revealed the presence of genotypes circulating among giant anteaters that had been previously identified in cattle blood samples from the same geographical region. These results confirm the presence of A. marginale in giant anteaters in Corrientes and suggests that A. dubitatum and A. sculptum ticks could be involved in the transmission among giant anteaters. Future studies will determine the role of these tick species in the wild transmission cycle in the study area and the eventual connection with the domestic cycle. "
Quasi-Static Shear Test of Hybrid Adhesive Bonds Based on Treated Cotton-Epoxy Resin Layer,"This research evaluates the mechanical properties of hybrid adhesive bonds with various 100% cotton fabrics in static and quasi-static conditions and the influence of alkali surface treatment (NaOH) of the cotton fabrics on the mechanical properties. Biological fibers in polymers are characterized by low wettability with the matrix, which decreases mechanical properties. Adhesive bonds usually operate in cyclic stress, which causes irreversible failure before maximal strength. In this paper, a quasi-static test was used to load the adhesive bonds in 5–50% (192–1951 N) and 5–70% (192–2732 N) intervals with 1000 cycles. The results of SEM analysis showed good wettability of alkali treated cotton fabric with NaOH solution in hybrid adhesive bonds. The static test proved the influence of reinforcing cotton fabrics on shear tensile strength against pure resin, i.e., sample Erik up to 19% on 14.90  1.15 MPa and sample Tera up to 21% on 15.28  1.05 MPa. The adhesive bonds with pure resin did not resist either quasi-static tests. Reinforcing cotton fabrics resisted both quasi-static tests, even shear tensile strength increases up to 10% on 16.34  1.24 MPa for the fabric Erik. The results of strain difference of adhesive bonds with Tera and Erik confirmed that a lower value of the difference during cyclic loading positively influenced the ultimate shear tensile strength. "

A Materials Bank for Circular Leuven: How to Monitor ‘Messy’ Circular City Transition Projects,"In recent years, cities have revealed themselves as being prominent actors in the circular economy transition. Besides supporting and initiating urban projects catalyzing circularity, cities are looking for monitoring tools that can make their progress towards circularity visible. Adopting Leuven’s pilot project for a building materials bank as a case study, this paper notes the particular challenges and opportunities in the pilot project to assess its progress and impact, in combination with gathering data for overall circular city monitoring purposes. Firstly, the paper names tensions between the “messy” transition process from policy ambitions to implementation and the question of data and monitoring. Secondly, the paper identifies relevant dimensions and scales to evaluate progress and impacts of a building materials bank, drawing from its development process. Thirdly, it proposes guidelines to monitor and evaluate circular city projects from the bottom up, combining quantitative indicators with guiding questions in a developmental evaluation. The analysis serves a critical reflection, distills lessons learned for projects contributing to circular cities and feeds a few concluding policy recommendations. The case study serves as an example that, in order to move beyond the tensions between circularity monitoring and actual circular city project development, monitoring instruments should simultaneously interact with and feed the circularity transition process. Therefore, dedicated data governance driven by enhanced stakeholder interactions should be inscribed in transition process guidance. Bottom-up projects such as a building materials bank provide opportunities to do this. "
Novel Approaches for the Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious airborne disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which primarily affects human lungs. The progression of drug-susceptible TB to drug-resistant strains, MDR-TB and XDR-TB, has become worldwide challenge in eliminating TB. The limitations of conventional TB treatment including frequent dosing and prolonged treatment, which results in patient’s noncompliance to the treatment because of treatment-related adverse effects. The non-invasive pulmonary drug administration provides the advantages of targeted-site delivery and avoids first-pass metabolism, which reduced the dose requirement and systemic adverse effects of the therapeutics. With the modification of the drugs with advanced carriers, the formulations may possess sustained released property, which helps in reducing the dosing frequency and enhanced patients’ compliances. The dry powder inhaler formulation is easy to handle and storage as it is relatively stable compared to liquids and suspension. This review mainly highlights the aerosolization properties of dry powder inhalable formulations with different anti-TB agents to understand and estimate the deposition manner of the drug in the lungs. Moreover, the safety profile of the novel dry powder inhaler formulations has been discussed. The results of the studies demonstrated that dry powder inhaler formulation has the potential in enhancing treatment efficacy. "
Activation of the Ion Channel TRPV4 Induces Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition in Breast Cancer Cells,"Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer is important in therapeutic resistance and invasiveness. Calcium signaling is key to the induction of EMT in breast cancer cells. Although inhibition of specific calcium-permeable ion channels regulates the induction of a sub-set of EMT markers in breast cancer cells, it is still unclear if activation of a specific calcium channel can be a driver for the induction of EMT events. In this study, we exploited the availability of a selective pharmacological activator of the calcium-permeable ion channel TRPV4 to assess the direct role of calcium influx in EMT marker induction. Gene association studies revealed a link between TRPV4 and gene-ontologies associated with EMT and poorer relapse-free survival in lymph node-positive basal breast cancers. TRPV4 was an important component of the calcium influx phase induced in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells by the EMT inducer epidermal growth factor (EGF). Pharmacological activation of TRPV4 then drove the induction of a variety of EMT markers in breast cancer cells. These studies demonstrate that calcium influx through specific pathways appears to be sufficient to trigger EMT events. "
Development of an In Vitro Membrane Model to Study the Function of EsxAB Heterodimer and Establish the Role of EsxB in Membrane Permeabilizing Activity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis,"EsxA and EsxB are secreted as a heterodimer and have been shown to play critical roles in phagosome rupture and translocation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis into the cytosol. Recent in vitro studies have suggested that the EsxAB heterodimer is dissociated upon acidification, which might allow EsxA insertion into lipid membranes. While the membrane permeabilizing activity (MPA) of EsxA has been well characterized in liposomes composed of di-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), the MPA of EsxAB heterodimer has not been detected through in vitro assays due to its negligible activity with DOPC liposomes. In this study, we established a new in vitro membrane assay to test the MPA activity of N-terminal acetylated EsxA (N-EsxA). We established that a dose-dependent increase in anionic charged lipids enhances the MPA of N-EsxA. The MPA of both N-EsxA and EsxAB were significantly increased with this new liposome system and made it possible to characterize the MPA of EsxAB in more physiologically-relevant conditions. We tested, for the first time, the effect of temperature on the MPA of N-EsxA and EsxAB in this new system. Interestingly, the MPA of N-EsxA was lower at 37 C than at RT, and on the contrary, the MPA of EsxAB was higher at 37 C than at RT. Surprisingly, after incubation at 37 C, the MPA of N-EsxA continuously decreased over time, while MPA of EsxAB remained stable, suggesting EsxB plays a key role in stabilizing N-EsxA to preserve its MPA at 37 C. In summary, this study established a new in vitro model system that characterizes the MPA of EsxAB and the role of EsxB at physiological-relevant conditions. "
"Origin of the Inclusions in Production-Scale Electrodes, ESR Ingots, and PESR Ingots in a Martensitic Stainless Steel","The focus of the study was to define the origin of the inclusions in production-scale electro-slag remelting, (ESR) and electro-slag remelting under a protected pressure controlled atmosphere, (PESR), ingots. The inclusion characteristics in production samples were studied using both polished sample surfaces (two-dimensional (2-D) investigations) and inclusions extracted from steel samples by electrolytic extraction (three-dimensional (3-D) investigations) using SEM in combination with EDS. The results were compared to results from previously reported laboratory-, pilot-, and production-scale trials including electrode, remelted, and conventional ingots. The results show that primary, semi-secondary, and secondary inclusions exist in the remelted ingots. The most probable inclusion to survive from the electrode is a MgO-Al2O3 (spinel). It was also found that the ESR/PESR process slag acts in a similar way to a calcium treatment modification of alumina inclusions. On the whole, the most significant finding is that the overall cleanliness of the electrode including the inclusions in the electrode has an influence on the inclusion content of the ESR and PESR ingots.

Minimal-Invasive Versus Open Hepatectomy for Colorectal Liver Metastases: Bicentric Analysis of Postoperative Outcomes and Long-Term Survival Using Propensity Score Matching Analysis,"Minimal-invasive hepatectomy (MIH) has been increasingly performed for benign and malignant liver lesions with most promising short-term results. However, the oncological role of MIH in the treatment of patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) needs further investigation. Clinicopathological data of patients who underwent liver resection for CRLM between 2012 and 2017 at the Department of Surgery, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, and the Inselspital Bern were assessed. Postoperative outcomes und long-term survivals of patients following MIH were compared with those after conventional open hepatectomy (OH) after 1:1 propensity score matching. During the study period, 229 and 91 patients underwent liver resection for CRLM at the Charité Berlin and the Inselspital Bern, respectively. Patients who underwent MIH in one of the two centers (n "
Gender and Age Differences in Loneliness: Evidence for People without and with Disabilities,"This study examines the relationships between loneliness, gender, and age for people without and with disabilities (moderate versus severe) in Germany. Using data taken from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) for the years 2013 and 2017 and using the UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles) Loneliness Scale, in general we found that males report lower loneliness scores as compared to those for females. Furthermore, we found a strong association between loneliness and the individual’s age, but with differences according to gender and disability status. For example, for males with severe disabilities levels of loneliness decrease with age, whereas for females with severe disabilities the opposite result is found. In addition, we found that participation in leisure activities and having a higher frequency of contacts with family, friends, and social online networks (measured by the relational time index) contribute to reducing loneliness for all individuals. From a public policy perspective, it is necessary to undertake the design, promotion, and implementation of instrumental, emotional, and social support measures for people with disabilities (in particular for females that are severely limited in their daily activities), which can contribute to reducing their loneliness scores and increasing their levels of life satisfaction.

Seascape Genomics of the Sugar Kelp Saccharina latissima along the North Eastern Atlantic Latitudinal Gradient,"Temperature is one of the most important range-limiting factors for many seaweeds. Driven by the recent climatic changes, rapid northward shifts of species’ distribution ranges can potentially modify the phylogeographic signature of Last Glacial Maximum. We explored this question in detail in the cold-tolerant kelp species Saccharina latissima, using microsatellites and double digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing ( ddRAD-seq) derived single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to analyze the genetic diversity and structure in 11 sites spanning the entire European Atlantic latitudinal range of this species. In addition, we checked for statistical correlation between genetic marker allele frequencies and three environmental proxies (sea surface temperature, salinity, and water turbidity). Our findings revealed that genetic diversity was significantly higher for the northernmost locality (Spitsbergen) compared to the southern ones (Northern Iberia), which we discuss in light of the current state of knowledge on phylogeography of S. latissima and the potential influence of the recent climatic changes on the population structure of this species. Seven SNPs and 12 microsatellite alleles were found to be significantly associated with at least one of the three environmental variables. We speculate on the putative adaptive functions of the genes associated with the outlier markers and the importance of these markers for successful conservation and aquaculture strategies for S. latissima in this age of rapid global change.

Photo-Crosslinked Silk Fibroin for 3D Printing,"Silk fibroin in material formats provides robust mechanical properties, and thus is a promising protein for 3D printing inks for a range of applications, including tissue engineering, bioelectronics, and bio-optics. Among the various crosslinking mechanisms, photo-crosslinking is particularly useful for 3D printing with silk fibroin inks due to the rapid kinetics, tunable crosslinking dynamics, light-assisted shape control, and the option to use visible light as a biocompatible processing condition. Multiple photo-crosslinking approaches have been applied to native or chemically modified silk fibroin, including photo-oxidation and free radical methacrylate polymerization. The molecular characteristics of silk fibroin, i.e., conformational polymorphism, provide a unique method for crosslinking and microfabrication via light. The molecular design features of silk fibroin inks and the exploitation of photo-crosslinking mechanisms suggest the exciting potential for meeting many biomedical needs in the future. "

Purification and Chemical Characterization of a Potent Acaricide and a Closely Related Inactive Metabolite Produced by Eurotium rubrum C47,"Mites are arthropods and some of them infest dry meat cured products and produce allergic reactions. Some mites, such as Tyrolichus casei, Tyrophagus putrescentiae, or Tyrophagus longior feed on filamentous fungi that grow during the meat curing process. Removal of mite infestation of meat products is extremely difficult and there are no adequate miticidal compounds. The filamentous fungus Eurotium rubrum growing on the surface of ham is able to exert a biocontrol of the population of mites due to the production of miticidal compound(s). We have purified two compounds by silica gel chromatography, gel filtration, semipreparative and analytical HPLC and determined their miticidal activity against T. casei using a mite feeding assay. Mass spectrometry and NMR analysis showed that these two compounds are prenylated salicilyl aldehydes with a C-7 alkyl chain differing in a double bond in the C-7 alkyl chain. Structures correspond to those of flavoglaucin and aspergin. Pure flavoglaucin has a miticidal activity resulting in more than 90% mite mortality whereas aspergin does not affect the mites. Both compounds were formed simultaneously by E. rubrum C47 cultures in different media suggesting that they are synthesized by the same pathway. Production of both compounds was higher in solid culture media and the products were associated with abundant formation of cleistothecia. In liquid cultures both compounds remained mainly cell-associated and only about 10% of the total compounds was released to the culture broth. This miticidal compound may be used to combat efficiently mite infestation in different habitats. These results, will promote further advances on the utilization of flavoglaucin in food preservation and in human health since this compound has antitumor activity. "
Review of Selected Performance Measurement Models Used in Public Administration,"The main goal of this article is to define the characteristics of and to evaluate the three selected models used to measure the performance of public administration bodies, with an emphasis placed on their application in different perspectives. The contemporary public administration institutions are obligated to increase their operating efficiency as well as the satisfaction of their stakeholders. This is precisely why they have been implementing diverse models, especially those already used for years in managing profit-oriented organisations. The models chosen for analysis are applied in public administration, making it possible to measure numerous indicators of both financial and nonfinancial nature. The research method adopted by the authors is a conceptual literature review performed using the resources of the Scopus, Springer, WoS, Emerald, and EBSCO databases. The items subject to analysis were the 3Es (i.e., economy, efficiency, effectiveness) and IOO (e.g., input, output, and outcome) models as well as the model included in the BSC (Balance Scorecard). The research has evidenced that each of the models has its strengths and limitations. The results thus obtained have led to a conclusion that the solution showing the highest potential in the area of the study is the performance measurement model proposed under the BSC; however, according to the authors, it still requires some fine-tuning to public administration’s operating conditions and organisational culture. The article also highlights the fundamental operationalisation problems related to the subject in question. "
Involvement of the FAK Network in Pathologies Related to Altered Mechanotransduction,"Mechanotransduction is a physiological process in which external mechanical stimulations are perceived, interpreted, and translated by cells into biochemical signals. Mechanical stimulations exerted by extracellular matrix stiffness and cell–cell contacts are continuously applied to living cells, thus representing a key pivotal trigger for cell homeostasis, survival, and function, as well as an essential factor for proper organ development and metabolism. Indeed, a deregulation of the mechanotransduction process consequent to gene mutations or altered functions of proteins involved in perceiving cellular and extracellular mechanics can lead to a broad range of diseases, from muscular dystrophies and cardiomyopathies to cancer development and metastatization. Here, we recapitulate the involvement of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in the cellular conditions deriving from altered mechanotransduction processes. "
The Evolving Knowledge on T and NK Cells in Classic Hodgkin Lymphoma: Insights into Novel Subsets Populating the Immune Microenvironment,"Classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is a unique lymphoid neoplasm characterized by extensive immune infiltrates surrounding rare malignant Hodgkin Reed–Sternberg (HRS) cells. Different subsets of T and NK cells have long been recognized in the cHL microenvironment, yet their distinct contribution to disease pathogenesis has remained enigmatic. Very recently, novel platforms for high dimensional analysis of immune cells, such as single-cell RNA sequencing and mass cytometry, have revealed unanticipated insights into the composition of T- and NK-cell compartments in cHL. Advances in imaging techniques have better defined specific T-helper subpopulations physically interacting with neoplastic cells. In addition, the identification of novel cytotoxic subsets with an exhausted phenotype, typically enriched in cHL milieu, is shedding light on previously unrecognized immune evasion mechanisms. This review examines the immunological features and the functional properties of T and NK subsets recently identified in the cHL microenvironment, highlighting their pathological interplay with HRS cells. We also discuss how this knowledge can be exploited to predict response to immunotherapy and to design novel strategies to improve PD-1 blockade efficacy. "
The Suitability of Glioblastoma Cell Lines as Models for Primary Glioblastoma Cell Metabolism,"In contrast to most non-malignant tissue, cells comprising the brain tumour glioblastoma (GBM) preferentially utilise glycolysis for metabolism via “the Warburg effect”. Research into therapeutics targeting the disease’s highly glycolytic state offer a promising avenue to improve patient survival. These studies often employ GBM cell lines for in vitro studies which translate poorly to the in vivo patient context. The metabolic traits of five of the most used GBM cell lines were assessed and compared to primary GBM and matched, healthy brain tissue. In patient-derived GBM cell lines, the basal mitochondrial rate (p "
"Pandemic-Driven Development of a Medical-Grade, Economic and Decentralized Applicable Polyolefin Filament for Additive Fused Filament Fabrication","A polyolefin with certified biocompatibility according to USP class VI was used by our group as feedstock for filament-based 3D printing to meet the highest medical standards in order to print personal protective equipment for our university hospital during the ongoing pandemic. Besides the chemical resistance and durability, as well as the ability to withstand steam sterilization, this polypropylene (PP) copolymer is characterized by its high purity, as achieved by highly efficient and selective catalytic polymerization. As the PP copolymer is suited to be printed with all common printers in fused filament fabrication (FFF), it offers an eco-friendly cost–benefit ratio, even for large-scale production. In addition, a digital workflow was established focusing on common desktop FFF printers in the medical sector. It comprises the simulation-based optimization of personalized print objects, considering the inherent material properties such as warping tendency, through to validation of the process chain by 3D scanning, sterilization, and biocompatibility analysis of the printed part. This combination of digital data processing and 3D printing with a sustainable and medically certified material showed great promise in establishing decentralized additive manufacturing in everyday hospital life to meet peaks in demand, supply bottlenecks, and enhanced personalized patient treatment.

Effect of Choice of Solvent on Crystallization Pathway of Paracetamol: An Experimental and Theoretical Case Study,"The choice of solvents influences crystalline solid formed during the crystallization of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). The underlying effects are not always well understood because of the complexity of the systems. Theoretical models are often insufficient to describe this phenomenon. In this study, the crystallization behavior of the model drug paracetamol in different solvents was studied based on experimental and molecular dynamics data. The crystallization process was followed in situ using time-resolved Raman spectroscopy. Molecular dynamics with simulated annealing algorithm was used for an atomistic understanding of the underlying processes. The experimental and theoretical data indicate that paracetamol molecules adopt a particular geometry in a given solvent predefining the crystallization of certain polymorphs. "
Wearable Inertial Sensors for Gait Analysis in Adults with Osteoarthritis—A Scoping Review,"Our objective was to conduct a scoping review which summarizes the growing body of literature using wearable inertial sensors for gait analysis in lower limb osteoarthritis. We searched six databases using predetermined search terms which highlighted the broad areas of inertial sensors, gait, and osteoarthritis. Two authors independently conducted title and abstract reviews, followed by two authors independently completing full-text screenings. Study quality was also assessed by two independent raters and data were extracted by one reviewer in areas such as study design, osteoarthritis sample, protocols, and inertial sensor outcomes. A total of 72 articles were included, which studied the gait of 2159 adults with osteoarthritis (OA) using inertial sensors. The most common location of OA studied was the knee (n "
Antimicrobial Action and Reversal of Resistance in MRSA by Difluorobenzamide Derivatives Targeted at FtsZ,"The bacterial cell division protein, FtsZ, has been identified as a target for antimicrobial development. Derivatives of 3-methoxybenzamide have shown promising activities as FtsZ inhibitors in Gram-positive bacteria. We sought to characterise the activity of five difluorobenzamide derivatives with non-heterocyclic substituents attached through the 3-oxygen. These compounds exhibited antimicrobial activity against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), with an isopentyloxy- substituted compound showing modest activity against vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE). The compounds were able to reverse resistance to oxacillin in highly resistant clinical MRSA strains at concentrations far below their MICs. Three of the compounds inhibited an Escherichia coli strain lacking the AcrAB components of a drug efflux pump, which suggests the lack of Gram-negative activity can partly be attributed to efflux. The compounds inhibited cell division by targeting S. aureus FtsZ, producing a dose-dependent increase in GTPase rate which increased the rate of FtsZ polymerization and stabilized the FtsZ polymers. These compounds did not affect the polymerization of mammalian tubulin and did not display haemolytic activity or cytotoxicity. These derivatives are therefore promising compounds for further development as antimicrobial agents or as resistance breakers to re-sensitive MRSA to beta-lactam antibiotics. "
Gait Trajectory and Gait Phase Prediction Based on an LSTM Network,"Lower body segment trajectory and gait phase prediction is crucial for the control of assistance-as-needed robotic devices, such as exoskeletons. In order for a powered exoskeleton with phase-based control to determine and provide proper assistance to the wearer during gait, we propose an approach to predict segment trajectories up to 200 ms ahead (angular velocity of the thigh, shank and foot segments) and five gait phases (loading response, mid-stance, terminal stance, preswing and swing), based on collected data from inertial measurement units placed on the thighs, shanks, and feet. The approach we propose is a long-short term memory (LSTM)-based network, a modified version of recurrent neural networks, which can learn order dependence in sequence prediction problems. The algorithm proposed has a weighted discount loss function that places more weight in predicting the next three to five time frames but also contributes to an overall prediction performance for up to 10 time frames. The LSTM model was designed to learn lower limb segment trajectories using training samples and was tested for generalization across participants. All predicted trajectories were strongly correlated with the measured trajectories, with correlation coefficients greater than 0.98. The proposed LSTM approach can also accurately predict the five gait phases, particularly swing phase with 95% accuracy in inter-subject implementation. The ability of the LSTM network to predict future gait trajectories and gait phases can be applied in designing exoskeleton controllers that can better compensate for system delays to smooth the transition between gait phases.

High-Toughness Poly(Lactic Acid)/Starch Blends Prepared through Reactive Blending Plasticization and Compatibilization,"In this study, poly(lactic acid) (PLA)/starch blends were prepared through reactive melt blending by using PLA and starch as raw materials and vegetable oil polyols, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and citric acid (CA) as additives. The effects of CA and PEG on the toughness of PLA/starch blends were analyzed using a mechanical performance test, scanning electron microscope analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, rheological analysis, and hydrophilicity test. Results showed that the elongation at break and impact strength of the PLA/premixed starch (PSt)/PEG/CA blend were 140.51% and 3.56 kJm-2, which were 13.4 and 1.8 times higher than those of pure PLA, respectively. The essence of the improvement in the toughness of the PLA/PSt/PEG/CA blend was the esterification reaction among CA, PEG, and starch. During the melt-blending process, the CA with abundant carboxyl groups reacted in the amorphous region of the starch. The shape and crystal form of the starch did not change, but the surface activity of the starch improved and consequently increased the adhesion between starch and PLA. As a plasticizer for PLA and starch, PEG effectively enhanced the mobility of the molecular chains. After PEG was dispersed, it participated in the esterification reaction of CA and starch at the interface and formed a branched/crosslinked copolymer that was embedded in the interface of PLA and starch. This copolymer further improved the compatibility of the PLA/starch blends. PEGs with small molecules and CA were used as compatibilizers to reduce the effect on PLA biodegradability. The esterification reaction on the starch surface improved the compatibilization and toughness of the PLA/starch blend materials and broadens their application prospects in the fields of medicine and high-fill packaging.

The Multiple Origins of Roe Deer Populations in Western Iberia and Their Relevance for Conservation,"The roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) is native and widespread in Europe and its phylogeography has been clarified in the last decades. Southern peninsulas are considered as reservoirs of genetic diversity and the source for the recolonization of Europe after the last glacial maximum. Even though roe deer populations have been genetically characterized, there is a major knowledge gap about the populations at the western edge of its distribution. To fill this caveat, and based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data, we aim to: (i) characterize the genetic diversity and structure of roe deer in western Iberia; (ii) clarify the origins and phylogeographical affinities of these populations, namely the relict population from Peneda Gers National Park (PNPG, Portugal) and the likely allochthonous populations from central and south (CS) Portugal; (iii) discuss the implications of our findings for the management and conservation of the roe deer. Three major genetic clusters were inferred based on nuclear genotypes and were structured in a similar way as the three major mtDNA clades present in Iberia. Patterns inferred with nuclear markers confirmed PNPG as a relict population. Roe deer from CS Portugal share haplotypes with Central Europe rather than with other western Iberian populations, confirming its mainly allochthonous origin. Our results highlight western Iberia as a diversity hotspot for roe deer. We highlight the role of intraspecific genetic diversity as a source of resilience against ongoing global changes; the need for transboundary management and the importance of genetic data to inform management and conservation. When considered, repopulation or translocation measures should follow the IUCN Law of Reintroductions and meticulously conducted in order to preserve the genetic heritage of the species. "
Leveraging 3D Model Systems to Understand Viral Interactions with the Respiratory Mucosa,"Respiratory viruses remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the human population, underscoring the importance of ongoing basic research into virus–host interactions. However, many critical aspects of infection are difficult, if not impossible, to probe using standard cell lines, 2D culture formats, or even animal models. In vitro systems such as airway epithelial cultures at air–liquid interface, organoids, or ‘on-chip’ technologies allow interrogation in human cells and recapitulate emergent properties of the airway epithelium—the primary target for respiratory virus infection. While some of these models have been used for over thirty years, ongoing advancements in both culture techniques and analytical tools continue to provide new opportunities to investigate airway epithelial biology and viral infection phenotypes in both normal and diseased host backgrounds. Here we review these models and their application to studying respiratory viruses. Furthermore, given the ability of these systems to recapitulate the extracellular microenvironment, we evaluate their potential to serve as a platform for studies specifically addressing viral interactions at the mucosal surface and detail techniques that can be employed to expand our understanding.

The Needle in the Haystack—Searching for Genetic and Epigenetic Differences in Monozygotic Twins Discordant for Tetralogy of Fallot,"Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most common birth defect in human with an incidence of almost 1% of all live births. Most cases have a multifactorial origin with both genetics and the environment playing a role in its development and progression. Adding an epigenetic component to this aspect is exemplified by monozygotic twins which share the same genetic background but have a different disease status. As a result, the interplay between the genetic, epigenetic and the environmental conditions might contribute to the etiology and phenotype. To date, the underlying causes of the majority of CHDs remain poorly understood. In this study, we performed genome-wide high-throughput sequencing to examine the genetic, structural genomic and epigenetic differences of two identical twin pairs discordant for Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), representing the most common cyanotic form of CHDs. Our results show the almost identical genetic and structural genomic identity of the twins. In contrast, several epigenetic alterations could be observed given by DNA methylation changes in regulatory regions of known cardiac-relevant genes. Overall, this study provides first insights into the impact of genetic and especially epigenetic factors underlying monozygotic twins discordant for CHD like TOF. "
"Impedimetric Detection of Femtomolar Levels of Interleukin6, Interleukin 8, and Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha Based on Thermally Modified Nanotubular Titanium Dioxide Arrays","An inexpensive, easy to prepare, and label-free electrochemical impedance spectroscopy- based biosensor has been developed for the selective detection of human interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (CXCL8, IL-8), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)—potential inflammatory cancer biomarkers. We describe a, so far, newly developed and unexplored method to immobilize antibodies onto a titanium dioxide nanotube (TNT) array by physical adsorption. Immobilization of anti-IL-6, anti-IL-8, and anti-TNF on TNT and the detection of human IL-6, IL-8, and TNF were examined using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The impedimetric immunosensor demonstrates good selectivity and high sensitivity against human biomarker analytes and can detect IL-6, IL-8, and TNF at concentrations as low as 5 pg/mL, equivalent to the standard concentration of these proteins in human blood. The calibration curves evidenced that elaborated biosensors are sensitive to three cytokines within 5  2500 pg/mL in the 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline solution (pH 7.4). "
Shape Sensing of Plate Structures Using the Inverse Finite Element Method: Investigation of Efficient Strain–Sensor Patterns,"Methods for real-time reconstruction of structural displacements using measured strain data is an area of active research due to its potential application for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) and morphing structure control. The inverse Finite Element Method (iFEM) has been shown to be well suited for the full-field reconstruction of displacements, strains, and stresses of structures instrumented with discrete or continuous strain sensors. In practical applications, where the available number of sensors may be limited, the number and sensor positions constitute the key parameters. Understanding changes in the reconstruction quality with respect to sensor position is generally difficult and is the aim of the present work. This paper attempts to supplement the current iFEM modeling knowledge through a rigorous evaluation of several strain–sensor patterns for shape sensing of a rectangular plate. Line plots along various sections of the plate are used to assess the reconstruction quality near and far away from strain sensors, and the nodal displacements are studied as the sensor density increases. The numerical results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the strain sensors distributed along the plate boundary for reconstructing relatively simple displacement patterns, and highlight the potential of cross-diagonal strain–sensor patterns to improve the displacement reconstruction of more complex deformation patterns.

"Health-Related Quality of Life and Related Factors among Primary Caregivers of Children with Disabilities in Shanghai, China: A Cross-Sectional Study","Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of caregivers of children with disabilities (CWD) is important for both children’s rehabilitation and caregivers’ life, but the corresponding attention is far from enough in mainland China. Thus, we investigated the HRQOL of 170 caregivers and related factors in Shanghai. The 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) was used to measure HRQOL. The potential factors were collected, including child characteristics, caregiver characteristics, and environmental factors. Univariate analysis and multiple linear regression were performed to identify the key factors that could be intervened. Compared with the general population, caregivers of CWD had a slightly higher score on the physical component summary (PCS, 52.57  8.41), but the score of mental component summary (MCS, 31.58  7.72) was extremely low. Caregiver’s illness condition, family size, and household income were significant factors of physical HRQOL. Caregivers with illness and caregivers living in an extended family were associated with higher mental HRQOL. Whereas these two factors had opposite effects on physical HRQOL. This finding indicated poor mental HRQOL among caregivers of CWD in Shanghai and thus requiring urgent attention and intervention. Improving physical fitness, maintaining family integration, and providing financial support should be considered when developing intervention for this population. "
Symbiotic Regulatory Genes Controlling Nodule Development in Pisum sativum L.,"Analyses of natural variation and the use of mutagenesis and molecular-biological approaches have revealed 50 symbiotic regulatory genes in pea (Pisum sativum L.). Studies of genomic synteny using model legumes, such as Medicago truncatula Gaertn. and Lotus japonicus (Regel) K. Larsen, have identified the sequences of 15 symbiotic regulatory genes in pea. These genes encode receptor kinases, an ion channel, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, transcription factors, a metal transporter, and an enzyme. This review summarizes and describes mutant alleles, their phenotypic manifestations, and the functions of all identified symbiotic regulatory genes in pea. Some examples of gene interactions are also given. In the review, all mutant alleles in genes with identified sequences are designated and still-unidentified symbiotic regulatory genes of great interest are considered. The identification of these genes will help elucidate additional components involved in infection thread growth, nodule primordium development, bacteroid differentiation and maintenance, and the autoregulation of nodulation. The significance of symbiotic mutants of pea as extremely fruitful genetic models for studying nodule development and for comparative cell biology studies of legume nodules is clearly demonstrated. Finally, it is noted that many more sequences of symbiotic regulatory genes remain to be identified. Transcriptomics approaches and genome-wide sequencing could help address this challenge. "
Advances in Studies on the Pharmacological Activities of Fucoxanthin,"Fucoxanthin is a natural carotenoid derived mostly from many species of marine brown algae. It is characterized by small molecular weight, is chemically active, can be easily oxidized, and has diverse biological activities, thus protecting cell components from ROS. Fucoxanthin inhibits the proliferation of a variety of cancer cells, promotes weight loss, acts as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, interacts with the intestinal flora to protect intestinal health, prevents organ fibrosis, and exerts a multitude of other beneficial effects. Thus, fucoxanthin has a wide range of applications and broad prospects. This review focuses primarily on the latest progress in research on its pharmacological activity and underlying mechanisms. "
Impacts of Climate and Phenology on the Yields of Early Mature Rice in China,"Phenological variables are closely correlated with rice (Oryza sativa L.) yields as they play important roles in influencing and controlling the carbon allocations between plant organs, but their impacts on rice yields and their relative importance compared with climatic variables are not yet well investigated. In this study, the impacts and the relative importance of climatic and phenological variables on the yields of early mature rice were assessed using the trial data from 75 agricultural stations across China, spanning from 1981–2010. We found that both daily maximum (Tmax) and daily minimum (Tmin) temperatures during the growing season (from transplanting to maturity) increased significantly, while sunshine duration (SD) and precipitation (Prep) did not change significantly. The average transplanting date was advanced by 3.18 days/decade, and the heading (maturity) dates were delayed by 2.47 (4.55) days/decade, with yields significantly increased by 9.65 g/m3 per decade across all sites. Partial correlation coefficients between most phenological variables and rice yields were negative, whereas most of the climatic variables were positively correlated with rice yields. The average of partial correlation coefficients between transplanting, heading, and maturity dates and rice yields were -0.10, -0.15, and -0.01, respectively, and the average of coefficients between Tmax, Tmin, SD, and Prep and rice yields were 0.08, 0.02, 0.12, and -0.05, respectively. Interestingly enough, phenological variables were the dominating influencing factors on rice yields at 63% of the sites, suggesting that the relative importance of phenology to rice yields may be even higher than that of climate. The climatic variables were closely correlated with rice yields as they are fundamental growth materials for crops, and phenological variables strongly influenced the growth and development of rice. Our results highlight that phenology should be precisely evaluated in crop models to improve the accuracy of simulating their response to climate change. Furthermore, due to limited understanding of phenological processes, manipulative experiments are urgently needed to comprehensively improve our understanding of rice phenology and rice yield response to ongoing climate change.

Acute Myeloid Leukemia Stem Cells: The Challenges of Phenotypic Heterogeneity,"Patients suffering from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) show highly heterogeneous clinical outcomes. Next to variabilities in patient-specific parameters influencing treatment decisions and outcome, this is due to differences in AML biology. In fact, different genetic drivers may transform variable cells of origin and co-exist with additional genetic lesions (e.g., as observed in clonal hematopoiesis) in a variety of leukemic (sub)clones. Moreover, AML cells are hierarchically organized and contain subpopulations of more immature cells called leukemic stem cells (LSC), which on the cellular level constitute the driver of the disease and may evolve during therapy. This genetic and hierarchical complexity results in a pronounced phenotypic variability, which is observed among AML cells of different patients as well as among the leukemic blasts of individual patients, at diagnosis and during the course of the disease. Here, we review the current knowledge on the heterogeneous landscape of AML surface markers with particular focus on those identifying LSC, and discuss why identification and targeting of this important cellular subpopulation in AML remains challenging.

Extracellular Vesicles: Messengers of p53 in Tumor–Stroma Communication and Cancer Metastasis,"Tumor progression to a metastatic and ultimately lethal stage relies on a tumor-supporting microenvironment that is generated by reciprocal communication between tumor and stromal host cells. The tumor–stroma crosstalk is instructed by the genetic alterations of the tumor cells—the most frequent being mutations in the gene Tumor protein p53 (TP53) that are clinically correlated with metastasis, drug resistance and poor patient survival. The crucial mediators of tumor–stroma communication are tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), in particular exosomes, which operate both locally within the primary tumor and in distant organs, at pre-metastatic niches as the future sites of metastasis. Here, we review how wild-type and mutant p53 proteins control the secretion, size, and especially the RNA and protein cargo of tumor-derived EVs. We highlight how EVs extend the cell-autonomous tumor suppressive activity of wild-type p53 into the tumor microenvironment (TME), and how mutant p53 proteins switch EVs into oncogenic messengers that reprogram tumor–host communication within the entire organism so as to promote metastatic tumor cell dissemination.

Single-Option P300-BCI Performance Is Affected by Visual Stimulation Conditions,"The P300 paradigm is one of the most promising techniques for its robustness and reliability in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications, but it is not exempt from shortcomings. The present work studied single-trial classification effectiveness in distinguishing between target and non-target responses considering two conditions of visual stimulation and the variation of the number of symbols presented to the user in a single-option visual frame. In addition, we also investigated the relationship between the classification results of target and non-target events when training and testing the machine-learning model with datasets containing different stimulation conditions and different number of symbols. To this end, we designed a P300 experimental protocol considering, as conditions of stimulation: the color highlighting or the superimposing of a cartoon face and from four to nine options. These experiments were carried out with 19 healthy subjects in 3 sessions. The results showed that the Event-Related Potentials (ERP) responses and the classification accuracy are stronger with cartoon faces as stimulus type and similar irrespective of the amount of options. In addition, the classification performance is reduced when using datasets with different type of stimulus, but it is similar when using datasets with different the number of symbols. These results have a special connotation for the design of systems, in which it is intended to elicit higher levels of evoked potentials and, at the same time, optimize training time. "
Study of Machining Process of SiCp/Al Particle Reinforced Metal Matrix Composite Using Finite Element Analysis and Experimental Verification,"In this paper, a two-dimensional orthogonal cutting simulation model of SiCp/Al composite was established. The geometry and material constitutive model of the particle, the matrix, and the interface layer have been modeled respectively. In view of the distribution of the particles in the matrix, this paper proposed respectively a two-dimensional particle random distribution to simulate particles randomly distributed in the matrix. Then, the cutting state of SiC reinforced particles was analyzed, the novel approach was adopted the geometric shapes of SiC particles in this study is taken as an oval shape. Three different locations of SiC particle relative to the cutting tool path were simulated to analyze the cutting state such as particle removal. The interface layer was introduced to the case that the particle was on the cutting path to study the influence on the stress and strain transfer. Through the post-processing of simulation results, the influence of interface property on the composite reinforcement effect was studied quantificationally. Finally, the cutting process of SiCp/Al composite material was simulated. This paper studied the influence on the machined surface morphology, chip morphology, stress distribution, and cutting force of many factors of the cutting speed and the cutting thickness. The single factor orthogonal cutting experiment was designed the influence of cutting speed and feed rate on the cutting force. The cutting force results of the experiment and the simulation were compared through the deviation analysis, which verified the simulation model. "

AI-Optimized Technological Aspects of the Material Used in 3D Printing Processes for Selected Medical Applications,"While the intensity, complexity, and specificity of robotic exercise may be supported by patient-tailored three-dimensional (3D)-printed solutions, their performance can still be compromised by non-optimal combinations of technological parameters and material features. The main focus of this paper was the computational optimization of the 3D-printing process in terms of features and material selection in order to achieve the maximum tensile force of a hand exoskeleton component, based on artificial neural network (ANN) optimization supported by genetic algorithms (GA). The creation and 3D-printing of the selected component was achieved using Cura 0.1.5 software and 3D-printed using fused filament fabrication (FFF) technology. To optimize the material and process parameters we compared ten selected parameters of the two distinct printing materials (polylactic acid (PLA), PLA+) using ANN supported by GA built and trained in the MATLAB environment. To determine the maximum tensile force of the exoskeleton, samples were tested using an INSTRON 5966 universal testing machine. While the balance between the technical requirements and user safety constraints requires further analysis, the PLA-based 3D-printing parameters have been optimized. Additive manufacturing may support the successful printing of usable/functional exoskeleton components. The network indicated which material should be selected: Namely PLA+. AI-based optimization may play a key role in increasing the performance and safety of the final product and supporting constraint satisfaction in patient-tailored solutions. "
"Hormone Receptor Loss in Breast Cancer: Molecular Mechanisms, Clinical Settings, and Therapeutic Implications","Hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (HR+ BC) accounts for approximately 75% of new BC diagnoses. Despite the undisputable progresses obtained in the treatment of HR+ BC in recent years, primary or acquired resistance to endocrine therapies still represents a clinically relevant issue, and is largely responsible for disease recurrence after curative surgery, as well as for disease progression in the metastatic setting. Among the mechanisms causing primary or acquired resistance to endocrine therapies is the loss of estrogen/progesterone receptor expression, which could make BC cells independent of estrogen stimulation and, consequently, resistant to estrogen deprivation or the pharmacological inhibition of estrogen receptors. This review aims at discussing the molecular mechanisms and the clinical implications of HR loss as a result of the therapies used in the neoadjuvant setting or for the treatment of advanced disease in HR+ BC patients.

Challenges and Opportunities for Russian Higher Education amid COVID-19: Teachers’ Perspective,"The COVID-19 pandemic has tremendously affected higher education systems in Russia and all over the world, forcing to transform curriculum into an online format, which is a challenge for all the educational process participants. The current study discusses the implementation of online learning amid the COVID-19 pandemic in the Russian higher education context and investigates the challenges experienced by university teachers during this period to define their readiness for online education. To address the above-mentioned issues, a study was conducted in Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University. A variety of methods of scientific and pedagogical research were used including systematic structural analysis, synthesis, work with research papers, the generalization of experience and experimental work, observation, surveys, etc., with 87 university teachers asked to respond to several sets of questions describing their online teaching experience after the launch of online education amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis of the participants’ answers helped to identify the following main challenges experienced by university teachers: computer literacy level, the university electronic environment and support, academic staff readiness and students’ readiness for online learning, the last two being the most important hindering the implementation of the efficient online education process. It was also underlined by most respondents that methodological work of a teacher in a digital educational environment differs from conventional teaching methods. Thus, psychological, technological, methodological support and teachers’ professional development programs are of vital importance to minimize the negative impact of the rapid changes of the educational process and to ensure efficient online education.

Natural-Based Hydrogels for Tissue Engineering Applications,"In the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, hydrogels are used as biomaterials to support cell attachment and promote tissue regeneration due to their unique biomimetic characteristics. The use of natural-origin materials significantly influenced the origin and progress of the field due to their ability to mimic the native tissues’ extracellular matrix and biocompatibility. However, the majority of these natural materials failed to provide satisfactory cues to guide cell differentiation toward the formation of new tissues. In addition, the integration of technological advances, such as 3D printing, microfluidics and nanotechnology, in tissue engineering has obsoleted the first generation of natural-origin hydrogels. During the last decade, a new generation of hydrogels has emerged to meet the specific tissue necessities, to be used with state-of-the-art techniques and to capitalize the intrinsic characteristics of natural-based materials. In this review, we briefly examine important hydrogel crosslinking mechanisms. Then, the latest developments in engineering natural-based hydrogels are investigated and major applications in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine are highlighted. Finally, the current limitations, future challenges and opportunities in this field are discussed to encourage realistic developments for the clinical translation of tissue engineering strategies. "
Heterogeneity of Endocrinologic and Metabolic Parameters in Reproductive Age Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Women Concerning the Severity of Hyperandrogenemia—A New Insight on Syndrome Pathogenesis,"Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by hyperandrogenism, anovulation, infertility, obesity, and insulin resistance, which results in increased concentrations of testosterone (T), which disturbs follicular growth and ovulation. This study aimed to assess PCOS women’s clinical, endocrinological, and metabolic parameters concerning hyperandrogenism severity. Results: 314 women (mean age 27.3  4.6; mean body mass index (BMI) 25.7  5.6) with PCOS, were divided into terciles according to T concentrations: <0.64 ng/mL (group 1), 0.64 to 0.84 ng/mL (Group 2) and >0.84 ng/mL (group 3). The mean concentration of T in all women was 0.59 ng/mL and correlated negatively with the number of menstrual cycles per year (MPY) (r "
Alterins Produced by Oyster-Associated Pseudoalteromonas Are Antibacterial Cyclolipopeptides with LPS-Binding Activity,"Discovery after discovery, host-associated microbiota reveal a growing list of positive effects on host homeostasis by contributing to host nutrition, improving hosts' immune systems and protecting hosts against pathogens. In that context, a collection of oyster associated bacteria producing antibacterial compounds have been established to evaluate their role in non-host-derived immunity. Here, we described alterins; potent anti-Gram negative compounds produced by Pseudoalteromonas hCg-6 and hCg-42 isolated from different healthy oyster hemolymph. The strains hCg-6 and hCg-42 produce a set of at least seven antibacterial compounds, ranging from 926 to 982 Da structurally characterized as cyclolipopeptides (CLPs). Alterins share the same cationic heptapeptidic cycle connected via an amido bond to different hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails. Their MICs disclosed a potent antibacterial activity directed against Gram-negative bacteria including oyster and human pathogens that may confer a beneficial defense mechanism to the host but also represents an untapped source of new antibiotics. The alterins’ mechanisms of action have been deciphered: after binding to lipopolysaccharides (LPS), alterins provoke a membrane depolarization and permeabilization leading to bacterial lysis. As hCg-6 and hCg-42 produced a set of natural derivatives, the structure/activity relationship linked to the carbon tail is clarified. We showed that the hydrocarbon tail determines the LPS-binding properties of alterins and consequently their antibacterial activities. Its length and saturation seem to play a major role in this interaction. "
Predicting and Quantifying Antagonistic Effects of Natural Compounds Given with Chemotherapeutic Agents: Applications for High-Throughput Screening,"Natural products have been used for centuries to treat various human ailments. In recent decades, multi-drug combinations that utilize natural products to synergistically enhance the therapeutic effects of cancer drugs have been identified and have shown success in improving treatment outcomes. While drug synergy research is a burgeoning field, there are disagreements on the definitions and mathematical parameters that prevent the standardization and proper usage of the terms synergy, antagonism, and additivity. This contributes to the relatively small amount of data on the antagonistic effects of natural products on cancer drugs that can diminish their therapeutic efficacy and prevent cancer regression. The ability of natural products to potentially degrade or reverse the molecular activity of cancer therapeutics represents an important but highly under-emphasized area of research that is often overlooked in both pre-clinical and clinical studies. This review aims to evaluate the body of work surrounding the antagonistic interactions between natural products and cancer therapeutics and highlight applications for high-throughput screening (HTS) and deep learning techniques for the identification of natural products that antagonize cancer drug efficacy. "
Chemotherapy and Targeted Agents in the Treatment of Elderly Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the main causes of cancer death in the elderly. The older patients constitute a heterogeneous group in terms of functional status, comorbidities, and aging-related conditions. Therefore, therapeutic decisions need to be individualized. Additionally, a higher toxicity risk comes from the fact that pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drugs as well as the tissue tolerance can be altered with aging. Although the chemotherapy efficacy in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is similar for older and young patients, more toxicity is presented in the elderly. While the mono-chemotherapy provides the same benefit for young and older patients, doublets front-line chemotherapy improves progression-free survival (PFS) but not overall survival (OS) in the elderly. Furthermore, the benefit of the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy in older patients has been shown in several clinical trials, while the clinical data for the benefit of anti-epidermal growth factor antibodies are scarcer. Immunocheckpoint inhibitors could be an appropriate option for patients with microsatellite instability (MSI) tumors. A prior geriatric assessment is required before deciding the type of treatment in order to offer the best therapeutic option. "

Why to Buy Insurance? An Explainable Artificial Intelligence Approach,"We propose an Explainable AI model that can be employed in order to explain why a customer buys or abandons a non-life insurance coverage. The method consists in applying similarity clustering to the Shapley values that were obtained from a highly accurate XGBoost predictive classification algorithm. Our proposed method can be embedded into a technologically-based insurance service (Insurtech), allowing to understand, in real time, the factors that most contribute to customers’ decisions, thereby gaining proactive insights on their needs. We prove the validity of our model with an empirical analysis that was conducted on data regarding purchases of insurance micro-policies. Two aspects are investigated: the propensity to buy an insurance policy and the risk of churn of an existing customer. The results from the analysis reveal that customers can be effectively and quickly grouped according to a similar set of characteristics, which can predict their buying or churn behaviour well.  "
TRPML1—Emerging Roles in Cancer,"The mucolipin-1 (TRPML1) channel maintains lysosomal ionic homeostasis and regulates autophagic flux. Defects of TRPML1 lead to lysosomal storage diseases and neurodegeneration. In this report, we discuss emerging evidence pertaining to differential regulation of TRPML1 signaling pathways in cancer progression with the goal of leveraging the oncogenic potential of TRPML1 to inspire therapeutic interventions. "
Dual Role of the PTPN13 Tyrosine Phosphatase in Cancer,"In this review article, we present the current knowledge on PTPN13, a class I non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase identified in 1994. We focus particularly on its role in cancer, where PTPN13 acts as an oncogenic protein and also a tumor suppressor. To try to understand these apparent contradictory functions, we discuss PTPN13 implication in the FAS and oncogenic tyrosine kinase signaling pathways and in the associated biological activities, as well as its post-transcriptional and epigenetic regulation. Then, we describe PTPN13 clinical significance as a prognostic marker in different cancer types and its impact on anti-cancer treatment sensitivity. Finally, we present future research axes following recent findings on its role in cell junction regulation that implicate PTPN13 in cell death and cell migration, two major hallmarks of tumor formation and progression.

A Single Center Retrospective Review of Patients from Central Italy Tested for Melanoma Predisposition Genes,"Cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) is one of the most common skin cancers worldwide. CMM pathogenesis involves genetic and environmental factors. Recent studies have led to the identification of new genes involved in CMM susceptibility: beyond CDKN2A and CDK4, BAP1, POT1, and MITF were recently identified as potential high-risk melanoma susceptibility genes. This study is aimed to evaluate the genetic predisposition to CMM in patients from central Italy. From 1998 to 2017, genetic testing was performed in 888 cases with multiple primary melanoma and/or familial melanoma. Genetic analyses included the sequencing CDKN2A, CDK4, BAP1, POT1, and MITF in 202 cases, and of only CDKN2A and CDK4 codon 24 in 686 patients. By the evaluation of the personal and familial history, patients were divided in two clinical categories: “low significance” and “high significance” cases. 128 patients (72% belonging to the “high significance” category, 28% belonging to the “low significance” category) were found to carry a DNA change defined as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, variant of unknown significance (VUS)-favoring pathogenic or VUS. It is important to verify the genetic predisposition in CMM patients for an early diagnosis of further melanomas and/or other tumors associated with the characterized genotype. "
The Art of Mast Cell Adhesion,"Cell adhesion is one of the basic phenomena occurring in a living organism, affecting many other processes such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, or cell viability. Mast cells (MCs) are important elements involved in defending the host against various pathogens and regulating inflammatory processes. Due to numerous mediators, they are contributing to the modulation of many basic cellular processes in a variety of cells, including the expression and functioning of different adhesive molecules. They also express themselves many adhesive proteins, including ICAM-1, ICAM-3, VCAM-1, integrins, L-selectin, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin. These molecules enable MCs to interact with other cells and components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), creating structures such as adherens junctions and focal adhesion sites, and triggering a signaling cascade. A thorough understanding of these cellular mechanisms can create a better understanding of MC biology and reveal new goals for MC targeted therapy. This review will focus on the current knowledge of adhesion mechanisms with the involvement of MCs. It also provides insight into the influence of MCs or MC-derived mediators on the adhesion molecule expression in different cells. "
Nitric Oxide (NO) and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: NO Way to Go?,"The discordance between pre-clinical success and clinical failure of treatment options for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is significant. The termination of clinical trials investigating the phosphodiesterase inhibitors, sildenafil and tadalafil (which prolong the second messenger molecule of nitric oxide (NO) signaling), are prime examples of this. Both attenuated key dystrophic features in the mdx mouse model of DMD yet failed to modulate primary outcomes in clinical settings. We have previously attempted to modulate NO signaling via chronic nitrate supplementation of the mdx mouse but failed to demonstrate beneficial modulation of key dystrophic features (i.e., metabolism). Instead, we observed increased muscle damage and nitrosative stress which exacerbated MD. Here, we highlight that acute nitrite treatment of human DMD myoblasts is also detrimental and suggest strategies for moving forward with NO replacement therapy in DMD. "
Li-Distribution in Compounds of the Li2O-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-CaO System—A First Survey,"The recovery of critical elements in recycling processes of complex high-tech products is often limited when applying only mechanical separation methods. A possible route is the pyrometallurgical processing that allows transferring of important critical elements into an alloy melt. Chemical rather ignoble elements will report in slag or dust. Valuable ignoble elements such as lithium should be recovered out of that material stream. A novel approach to accomplish this is enrichment in engineered artificial minerals (EnAM). An application with a high potential for resource efficient solutions is the pyrometallurgical processing of Li ion batteries. Starting from comparatively simple slag compositions such as the Li-Al-Si-Ca-O system, the next level of complexity is reached when adding Mg, derived from slag builders or other sources. Every additional component will change the distribution of Li between the compounds generated in the slag. Investigations with powder X-Ray diffraction (PXRD) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) of solidified melt of the five-compound system Li2O-MgO-Al2O3- SiO2-CaO reveal that Li can occur in various compounds from beginning to the end of the crystallization. Among these compounds are Li1-x(Al1-xSix)O2, Li1-xMgy(Al)(Al3/2y+xSi2-x-3/2y)O6, solid solutions of Mg1-(3/2y)Al2+yO4/LiAl5O8 and Ca-alumosilicate (melilite). There are indications of segregation processes of Al-rich and Si(Ca)-rich melts. The experimental results were compared with solidification curves via thermodynamic calculations of the systems MgO-Al2O3 and Li2O-SiO2-Al2O3. "
Nano-Biomimetic Drug Delivery Vehicles: Potential Approaches for COVID-19 Treatment,"The current COVID-19 pandemic has tested the resolve of the global community with more than 35 million infections worldwide and numbers increasing with no cure or vaccine available to date. Nanomedicines have an advantage of providing enhanced permeability and retention and have been extensively studied as targeted drug delivery strategies for the treatment of different disease. The role of monocytes, erythrocytes, thrombocytes, and macrophages in diseases, including infectious and inflammatory diseases, cancer, and atherosclerosis, are better understood and have resulted in improved strategies for targeting and in some instances mimicking these cell types to improve therapeutic outcomes. Consequently, these primary cell types can be exploited for the purposes of serving as a “Trojan horse” for targeted delivery to identified organs and sites of inflammation. State of the art and potential utilization of nanocarriers such as nanospheres/nanocapsules, nanocrystals, liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles/nano-structured lipid carriers, dendrimers, and nanosponges for biomimicry and/or targeted delivery of bioactives to cells are reported herein and their potential use in the treatment of COVID-19 infections discussed. Physicochemical properties, viz., hydrophilicity, particle shape, surface charge, composition, concentration, the use of different target-specific ligands on the surface of carriers, and the impact on carrier efficacy and specificity are also discussed.

Topical Treatment of Elevated Intraocular Pressure in Patients with Graves’ Orbitopathy,"Purpose: In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of topical hypotensive treatment and/or systemic corticosteroids therapy in patients with elevated intraocular pressure and Graves’ orbitopathy (GO). Methods: We included 172 eyes in 86 individuals with duration of GO  3 months, intraocular pressure in either eye  25.0 mmHg, and GO ranked  3 at least in one eye in modified CAS form. The study subjects were divided into three treatment subgroups: subgroup I was administered latanoprost once a day; subgroup II was administered a combined preparation of brimonidine and timolol BID; subgroup III was the control group, not receiving any topical hypotensive treatment. All the study participants received systemic treatment, intravenous corticosteroid therapy at the same dose, according to the European Group of Graves’ Orbitopathy (EUGOGO) guideline. Results: On the final visit, the mean IOP value was significantly lower in all treatment subgroups compared to the initial values. In both subgroups receiving topical treatment, the IOP reduction was higher than in the control group receiving systemic corticosteroids only. However, the latanoprost eye drops decreased intraocular pressure more effectively than drops containing brimonidine and timolol. Conclusion: Topical ocular hypotensive treatment is effective in reducing intraocular pressure in GO and decreases intraocular pressure more effectively than systemic corticosteroid therapy alone. "
Radioprotective Effect of Flavonoids on Ionizing Radiation-Induced Brain Damage,"Patients receiving brain radiotherapy may suffer acute or chronic side effects. Ionizing radiation induces the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the central nervous system, leading to brain damage. Complementary Chinese herbal medicine therapy may reduce radiotherapy-induced side effects. Flavonoids are a class of natural products which can be extracted from Chinese herbal medicine and have been shown to have neuroprotective and radioprotective properties. Flavonoids are effective antioxidants and can also inhibit regulatory enzymes or transcription factors important for controlling inflammatory mediators, affect oxidative stress through interaction with DNA and enhance genomic stability. In this paper, radiation-induced brain damage and the relevant molecular mechanism were summarized. The radio-neuro-protective effect of flavonoids, i.e., antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and maintaining genomic stability, were then reviewed. We concluded that flavonoids treatment may be a promising complementary therapy to prevent radiotherapy-induced brain pathophysiological changes and cognitive impairment. "
B-Comet Assay (Comet Assay on Buccal Cells) for the Evaluation of Primary DNA Damage in Human Biomonitoring Studies,"Many subjects perceive venous blood collection as too invasive, and thus moving to better-accepted procedures for leukocytes collection might be crucial in human biomonitoring studies (e.g., biomonitoring of occupational or residential exposure to genotoxins) management. In this context, primary DNA damage was assessed in buccal lymphocytes (BLs), fresh whole venous, and capillary blood leukocytes, and compared with that in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs)—the most frequently used cells—in 15 young subjects. Mouthwashes were collected after the volunteers rinsed their mouths with normal saline, and BLs were isolated by density gradient centrifugation. Blood samples were collected by venipuncture or by lancet. Anthropometric and lifestyle information was obtained by the administration of a structured questionnaire. As shown in the Bland-Altman plots, the level of agreement between BLs and PBLs lied within the accepted range, we thus enrolled a wider population (n "
Newly Generated Atractylon Derivatives in Processed Rhizomes of Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz,"Thermally processed rhizomes of Atractylodes macrocephala (RAM) have a long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for treating various disorders, and have been an integral part of various traditional drugs and healthcare products. In TCM, herbal medicines are, in most cases, uniquely processed. Although it is thought that processing can alter the properties of herbal medicines so as to achieve desired functions, increase potency, and/or reduce side effects, the underlying chemical changes remain unclear for most thermally processed Chinese herbal medicines. In an attempt to shed some light on the scientific rationale behind the processes involved in traditional medicine, the RAM processed by stir-frying with wheat bran was investigated for the change of chemical composition. As a result, for the first time, five new chemical entities, along with ten known compounds, were isolated. Their chemical structures were determined by spectroscopic and spectrometric analyses. The possible synthetic pathway for the generation of such thermally-induced chemical entities was also proposed. Furthermore, biological activity evaluation showed that none of the compounds possessed cytotoxic effects against the tested mammalian cancer and noncancer cell lines. In addition, all compounds were ineffective at inhibiting the growth of the pathogenic microorganisms. "

Prebiotic Reaction Networks in Water,"A prevailing strategy in origins of life studies is to explore how chemistry constrained by hypothetical prebiotic conditions could have led to molecules and system level processes proposed to be important for life’s beginnings. This strategy has yielded model prebiotic reaction networks that elucidate pathways by which relevant compounds can be generated, in some cases, autocatalytically. These prebiotic reaction networks provide a rich platform for further understanding and development of emergent “life-like” behaviours. In this review, recent advances in experimental and analytical procedures associated with classical prebiotic reaction networks, like formose and Miller-Urey, as well as more recent ones are highlighted. Instead of polymeric networks, i.e., those based on nucleic acids or peptides, the focus is on small molecules. The future of prebiotic chemistry lies in better understanding the genuine complexity that can result from reaction networks and the construction of a centralised database of reactions useful for predicting potential network evolution is emphasised.

Antimicrobial Use Indices—The Value of Reporting Antimicrobial Use in Multiple Ways Using Data From Canadian Broiler Chicken and Turkey Farms,"We have previously described the importance of using multiple indicators for reporting national farm-level antimicrobial use (AMU) information, but the distribution of flock-level AMU and how these indicators relate to each other has not yet been fully explored. "
Fine-Scale Patterns of Genetic Structure in the Host Plant Chamaecrista fasciculata (Fabaceae) and Its Nodulating Rhizobia Symbionts,"In natural plant populations, a fine-scale spatial genetic structure (SGS) can result from limited gene flow, selection pressures or spatial autocorrelation. However, limited gene flow is considered the predominant determinant in the establishment of SGS. With limited dispersal ability of bacterial cells in soil and host influence on their variety and abundance, spatial autocorrelation of bacterial communities associated with plants is expected. For this study, we collected genetic data from legume host plants, Chamaecrista fasciculata, their Bradyrhizobium symbionts and rhizosphere free-living bacteria at a small spatial scale to evaluate the extent to which symbiotic partners will have similar SGS and to understand how plant hosts choose among nodulating symbionts. We found SGS across all sampled plants for both the host plants and nodulating rhizobia, suggesting that both organisms are influenced by similar mechanisms structuring genetic diversity or shared habitat preferences by both plants and microbes. We also found that plant genetic identity and geographic distance might serve as predictors of nodulating rhizobia genetic identity. Bradyrhizobium elkanii was the only type of rhizobia found in nodules, which suggests some level of selection by the host plant. "
Lung Regulatory T Cells Express Adiponectin Receptor 1: Modulation by Obesity and Airway Allergic Inflammation,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) decrease in the adipose tissue upon weight gain, contributing to persistent low-grade inflammation in obesity. We previously showed that adipose tissue Tregs express the adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1); however, the expression in lung Tregs is still unknown. Here, we aimed to determine whether Helios+ and Helios- Treg subsets expressed AdipoR1 in the lungs of obese mice and whether different obesity grades affected the expression upon allergic lung inflammation. For diet-induced obesity (DIO), mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for up to 15 weeks (overweight), 21 weeks (obesity), and 26 weeks (morbid obesity). Overweight and morbidly obese mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) to induce allergic lung inflammation. The AdipoR1 expression was reduced significantly in the lung Helios+ and Helios- Tregs of obese mice compared with lean mice. Airway allergic inflammation showed reduced AdipoR1 expression in lung Foxp3+ Tregs. Obesity significantly exacerbated the eosinophilic airway inflammation and reduced the number of Helios+ Tregs in lung and adipose tissue in the obesity-associated asthma model. Upon further weight gain, AdipoR1-expressing Tregs in the lungs of allergic mice were increased, whereas AdipoR1-expressing Tregs in adipose tissue were reduced. These data suggest that obesity-associated adipose tissue inflammation may exacerbate allergic inflammation by downregulating the AdipoR1+ Tregs in the lungs. "
Deregulation of Lipid Homeostasis: A Fa(c)t in the Development of Metabolic Diseases,"Lipids are important molecules for human health. The quantity and quality of fats consumed in the diet have important effects on the modulation of both the natural biosynthesis and degradation of lipids. There is an important number of lipid-failed associated metabolic diseases and an increasing number of studies suggesting that certain types of lipids might be beneficial to the treatment of many metabolic diseases. The aim of the present work is to expose an overview of de novo biosynthesis, storage, and degradation of lipids in mammalian cells, as well as, to review the published data describing the beneficial effects of these processes and the potential of some dietary lipids to improve metabolic diseases.

Exploring the Attractiveness of Residential Areas for Human Activities Based on Shared E-Bike Trajectory Data,"Human activities generate diverse and sophisticated functional areas and may impact the existing planning of functional areas. Understanding the relationship between human activities and functional areas is key to identifying the real-time urban functional areas based on trajectories. Few previous studies have analyzed the interactive information on humans and regions for functional area identification. The relationship between human activities and residential areas is the most representative for urban functional areas because residential areas cover a wide range and are closely connected with human life. The aim of this paper is to propose the CARA (Commuting Activity and Residential Area) model to quantify the correlation between human activities and urban residential areas. In this model, human activities are represented by hot spots extracted by the Gaussian Mixture Model algorithm while residential areas are represented by POI (point of interest) data. The model shows that human activities and residential areas present a logarithmic relationship. The CARA model is further assessed by retrieving urban residential areas in Tengzhou City from shared e-bike trajectories. Compared with the actual map, the accuracy reaches 83.3%, thus demonstrating the model’s reliability and feasibility. This study provides a new method for functional areas identification based on trajectory data, which is helpful for formulating the urban people-oriented policies. "
Functional Analysis of Adipokinetic Hormone Signaling in Bombyx mori,"Insect adipokinetic hormones (AKHs) are short peptides produced in the corpora cardiaca and are responsible for mobilizing energy stores from the fat body to the hemolymph. Three related peptides, AKH1, AKH2, and AKH/corazonin-related peptide (ACP) as well as three AKH receptors have been reported in Bombyx mori. AKH1 and AKH2 are specific for the AKHR1 receptor, whereas ACP interacts with the other two AKHRs. To assess the effect of the two silkworm AKHs and ACP in the regulation of energy homeostasis we examined the expression pattern of the three peptides and their receptors as well as their effect on the level of carbohydrates and lipids in the hemolymph. Our results support the hypothesis that only AKH1 and AKH2 peptides together with the AKHR1 receptor are involved in the maintenance of energy homeostasis. Because Bombyx AKHR1 (BmAKHR1) seems to be a true AKHR we generated its mutation. The BmAKHR1 mutant larvae display significantly lower carbohydrate and lipid levels in the hemolymph and reduced sensitivity to starvation. Our study clarifies the role of BmAKHR1 in energy homeostasis. "
Photons to Formate—A Review on Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Formic Acid,"Rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide due to the burning and depletion of fossil fuels is continuously raising environmental concerns about global warming and the future of our energy supply. Renewable energy, especially better utilization of solar energy, is a promising method for CO2 conversion and chemical storage. Research in the solar fuels area is focused on designing novel catalysts and developing new conversion pathways. In this review, we focus on the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 primarily in its neutral pH species of carbonate to formate. The first two-electron photoproduct of carbon dioxide, a case for formate (or formic acid) is made in this review based on its value as; an important chemical feedstock, a hydrogen storage material, an intermediate to methanol, a high-octane fuel and broad application in fuel cells. This review focuses specifically on the following photocatalysts: semiconductors, phthalocyanines as photosensitizers and membrane devices and metal-organic frameworks. "
Shear-Thickening Composites for On-Demand Rebound Performance and Softness,"For footwear insoles, high rebound performance is required in some instances such as for running, while softness for comfort is of higher importance during normal walking and standing to minimize high stress. Hence, materials with rebound performance in some scenarios and softness for other scenarios are desired. In this paper, we investigate rebound performance and hardness of composites made of a shear-thickening material and elastic foam. First, a hydrogel type of shear-thickening material (Slime) is characterized to investigate the influence of water content. After that, two particular shear-thickening hydrogels with better rebound performance (but not outstanding in the shear-thickening effect) are selected and integrated into the elastic foam to produce a composite insole. It is found that, as compared with the commercial elastic insole and commercial shear-thickening insole, softer and superior rebound performance can be achieved simultaneously only if the right shear-thickening material is used in the composite. "
Drug–Drug Interactions Involving Intestinal and Hepatic CYP1A Enzymes,"Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A enzymes are considerably expressed in the human intestine and liver and involved in the biotransformation of about 10% of marketed drugs. Despite this doubtless clinical relevance, CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 are still somewhat underestimated in terms of unwanted side effects and drug–drug interactions of their respective substrates. In contrast to this, many frequently prescribed drugs that are subjected to extensive CYP1A-mediated metabolism show a narrow therapeutic index and serious adverse drug reactions. Consequently, those drugs are vulnerable to any kind of inhibition or induction in the expression and function of CYP1A. However, available in vitro data are not necessarily predictive for the occurrence of clinically relevant drug–drug interactions. Thus, this review aims to provide an up-to-date summary on the expression, regulation, function, and drug–drug interactions of CYP1A enzymes in humans. "
"IL-24 Negatively Regulates Keratinocyte Differentiation Induced by Tapinarof, an Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Modulator: Implication in the Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis","Skin barrier dysfunction, including reduced filaggrin (FLG) and loricrin (LOR) expression, plays a critical role in atopic dermatitis (AD) development. Since aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a ligand-activated transcription factor, mediates keratinocyte differentiation, it is a potential target for AD treatment. Recently, clinical studies have shown that tapinarof, an AHR modulator, attenuated the development of AD. To examine the molecular mechanism involved in this, we analyzed tapinarof-treated normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs). Tapinarof upregulated FLG and LOR mRNA and protein expression in an AHR-dependent manner. Tapinarof also induced the secretion of IL-24, a cytokine that activates Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), leading to the downregulation of FLG and LOR expression. Knockdown of either IL-24 or STAT3 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection augmented the upregulation of FLG and LOR expression induced by tapinarof, suggesting that inhibition of the IL-24/STAT3 axis during AHR activation supports the improvement of skin barrier dysfunction. Furthermore, tapinarof alone could restore the downregulation of FLG and LOR expression induced by IL-4, a key cytokine of AD, and its combination with JAK inhibitors enhanced this effect. These findings provide a new strategy for treating AD using AHR modulators and JAK inhibitors. "
"Constraining the Water Cycle Model of an Important Karstic Catchment in Southeast Tibetan Plateau Using Isotopic Tracers (2H, 18O, 3H, 222Rn)","Understanding the connectivity between surface water and groundwater is key to sound geo-hazard prevention and mitigation in a waterscape such as the Jiuzhaigou Natural World Heritage Site in the southeast Tibetan Plateau, China. In this study, we used environmental isotope tracers (2H, 18O 3H, and 222Rn) to constrain a water cycle model including confirming hydrological pathways, connectivity, and water source identification in the Jiuzhaigou catchments. We established the local meteoric water line (LMWL) based on the weekly precipitation isotope sampling of a precipitation station. We systematically collected water samples from various water bodies in the study area to design the local water cycle model. The regional water level and discharge changes at one month after the earthquake indicated that there was a hydraulic connection underground across the local water divide between the Rize (RZ) river in the west and Zechawa (ZCW) lake in the east by the 18O and 2H measurements. We employed an end-member mixing model to identify and quantify Jiuzhaigou runoff-generating sources and their contributions, and we found that the average contributions of precipitation and groundwater to the surface runoff in the catchments are about 30% and 70%, respectively. The two branches of the Shuzheng (SZ) trunk were recharged by 62  19% from the ZCW lake and 38  19% from the RZ river, which was consistent with the fractions calculated by the actual discharge volume. 222Rn mass balance analyses were employed to estimate the water exchange between groundwater and river, which further confirmed this estimate. 222Rn concentrations and 3H contents showed that the groundwater had a short residence time and it was moderate precipitation, thought the contribution of groundwater to the river was 70%, according to the different tracers. A three-dimensional conceptual model of the water cycle that integrated the regional hydrological and geological conditions was established for the catchments. "
Multidisciplinary Management of Radiation-Induced Salivary Gland Carcinomas in the Modern Radiotherapy Era,"Clinical data of ri-SGCs patients treated between 2015 and 2019 at a tertiary cancer center and a national hadron therapy facility were reviewed. Latent time (LT) from first RT to ri-SGCs diagnosis, overall (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were assessed. Thirteen patients developed 14 ri-SGCs (one patient had 2 synchronous ri-SCGs), after a median LT of 23 years (range 16–34). Parotid was the primary site in 8 cases (57%) and salivary duct carcinoma was the most frequent histotype (29%). Nine patients (69%) underwent surgery (Sx). Among them, 4 patients (31%) underwent Sx alone, 5 received post-operative treatments: 3 (23%) photon-based (X) reRT, one (8%) protons and carbon ions, one (8%) carbon ions only. One patient (8%) received definitive XRT. The remaining 3 patients (23%) received androgen deprivation therapy. With a median follow-up of 48 months (range 24–72), median OS and PFS were 74 and 24 months, respectively. In the subgroup of AR+ ri-SGCs, median PFS and OS were 12 and 74 months, respectively. Given the rarity of ri-SGCs, this work adds further knowledge to the paucity of literature. The management of these malignancies is extremely complex requiring a multidisciplinary treatment approach.

Drug Delivery Systems on Leprosy Therapy: Moving Towards Eradication?,"Leprosy disease remains an important public health issue as it is still endemic in several countries. Mycobacterium leprae, the causative agent of leprosy, presents tropism for cells of the reticuloendothelial and peripheral nervous system. Current multidrug therapy consists of clofazimine, dapsone and rifampicin. Despite significant improvements in leprosy treatment, in most programs, successful completion of the therapy is still sub-optimal. Drug resistance has emerged in some countries. This review discusses the status of leprosy disease worldwide, providing information regarding infectious agents, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, actual treatment and future perspectives and strategies on targets for an efficient targeted delivery therapy.

A Novel Design of a 3D Racetrack Memory Based on Functional Segments in Cylindrical Nanowire Arrays,"A racetrack memory is a device where the information is stored as magnetic domains (bits) along a nanowire (track). To read and record the information, the bits are moved along the track by current pulses until they reach the reading/writing heads. In particular, 3D racetrack memory devices use arrays of vertically aligned wires (tracks), thus enhancing storage density. In this work, we propose a novel 3D racetrack memory configuration based on functional segments inside cylindrical nanowire arrays. The innovative idea is the integration of the writing element inside the racetrack itself, avoiding the need to implement external writing heads next to the track. The use of selective magnetic segments inside one nanowire allows the creation of writing and storage sections inside the same track, separated by chemical constraints identical to those separating the bits. Using micromagnetic simulations, our study reveals that if the writing section is composed of two segments with different coercivities, one can reverse its magnetization independently from the rest of the memory device by applying an external magnetic field. Spin-polarized current pulses then move the information bits along selected tracks, completing the writing process by pushing the new bit into the storage section of the wire. Finally, we have proven the efficacy of this system inside an array of 7 nanowires, opening the possibility to use this configuration in a 3D racetrack memory device composed of an array of thousands of nanowires produced by low-cost and high-yield template-electrodeposition methods.

Underlying Factors Explaining Physical Behaviors among Office Workers—An Exploratory Analysis,"Studies using technical measurements of physical behavior show wide interindividual variations. This study aimed to explore underlying factors related to sitting, standing and walking among office workers. Cross-sectional data for background characteristics, work-related variables, and device-based measures for sitting, standing and walking were collected among office workers in either a cell office or a flex office with activity-based work. Data were analyzed by Factor Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD) and multiple robust linear regression. The FAMD resulted in the combination of underlying factors describing six character types. The (1) harmonic and healthy, (2) disabled with poor health, (3) manager that spend a lot of time in meetings and has very high workload, (4) engaged with high workload, (5) employee with creative and computer intense work, with high workload and, (6) employee with high BMI with creative and collaborative work. Regression analysis showed that the character type that was “engaged with high workload” sat more and stood less, while the character type with ”high BMI and with creative and collaborative work” sat less. The results suggest that physical behavior among office workers is influenced by a complex combination of factors, which should be taken into account in the evaluation of future studies of larger cohorts.

CA125 and Ovarian Cancer: A Comprehensive Review,"Ovarian cancer is the second most lethal gynecological malignancy. The tumour biomarker CA125 has been used as the primary ovarian cancer marker for the past four decades. The focus on diagnosing ovarian cancer in stages I and II using CA125 as a diagnostic biomarker has not improved patients’ survival. Therefore, screening average-risk asymptomatic women with CA125 is not recommended by any professional society. The dualistic model of ovarian cancer carcinogenesis suggests that type II tumours are responsible for the majority of ovarian cancer mortality. However, type II tumours are rarely diagnosed in stages I and II. The recent shift of focus to the diagnosis of low volume type II ovarian cancer in its early stages of evolution provides a new and valuable target for screening. Type II ovarian cancers are usually diagnosed in advanced stages and have significantly higher CA125 levels than type I tumours. The detection of low volume type II carcinomas in stage IIIa/b is associated with a higher likelihood for optimal cytoreduction, the most robust prognostic indicator for ovarian cancer patients. The diagnosis of type II ovarian cancer in the early substages of stage III with CA125 may be possible using a higher cutoff point rather than the traditionally used 35 U/mL through the use of point-of-care CA125 assays in primary care facilities. Rapid point-of-care testing also has the potential for effective longitudinal screening and quick monitoring of ovarian cancer patients during and after treatment. This review covers the role of CA125 in the diagnosis and management of ovarian cancer and explores novel and more effective screening strategies with CA125. "
"Design, Plant Test and CFD Calculation of a Turbocharger for a Low-Speed Engine","Various approaches and techniques are used to design centrifugal compressors. These are engineering one-dimensional and quasi-three-dimensional programs, as well as CFD Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) programs. The final judgment about the effectiveness of the design is given by testing the compressor or its model. A centrifugal compressor for an internal combustion engine turbocharger was designed jointly by the Research Laboratory “Gas Dynamics of Turbomachines” of Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University (SPbPU) and RPA (Research and Production Association) “Turbotekhnika”. To check its dimensionless characteristics, the compressor was tested with two geometrically similar impellers with a diameter of 175 (TKR 175E) and 140 mm (TKR 140E). The mathematical model of the Universal Modeling Method calculates the efficiency in the design mode for all tests of both compressors with an error of 0.89%, and the efficiency for the entire characteristic with an error of 1.55%. The characteristics of the TKR 140E compressor were calculated using the ANSYS commercial CFD software. For TKR-140E, a significant discrepancy in the value of the efficiency was obtained, but a good agreement in the area of operation, which was not achieved in previous calculations. According to the calculation, the work coefficient is overestimated by 9%, which corresponds to the results of previous calculations by the authors. "
Design of Cyclone Separator Critical Diameter Model Based on Machine Learning and CFD,"In this paper, the characteristics of the cyclone separator was analyzed from the Lagrangian perspective for designing the important dependent variables. The neural network network model was developed for predicting the separation performance parameter. Further, the predictive performances were compared between the traditional surrogate model and the developed neural network model. In order to design the important parameters of the cyclone separator based on the particle separation theory, the force acting until the particles are separated was calculated using the Lagrangian-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology. As a result, it was proved that the centrifugal force and drag acting on the critical diameter having a separation efficiency of 50% were similar, and the particle separation phenomenon in the cyclone occurred from the critical diameter, and it was set as an important dependent variable. For developing a critical diameter prediction model based on machine learning and multiple regression methods, unsteady-Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes analyzes according to shape dimensions were performed. The input design variables for predicting the critical diameter were selected as four geometry parameters that affect the turbulent flow inside the cyclone. As a result of comparing the model prediction performances, the machine learning (ML) model, which takes into account the critical diameter and the nonlinear relationship of cyclone design variables, showed a 32.5% improvement in R-square compared to multi linear regression (MLR). The proposed techniques have proven to be fast and practical tools for cyclone design. "
Isolation of a Nitromethane Anion in the Calix-Shaped Inorganic Cage,"A calix-shaped polyoxometalate, [V12O32]4- (V12), stabilizes an anion moiety in its central cavity. This molecule-sized container has the potential to control the reactivity of an anion. The highly-reactive cyanate is smoothly trapped by V12 to form [V12O32(CN)]5-. In the CH3NO2 solution, cyanate abstracts protons from CH3NO2, and the resultant CH2NO2- is stabilized in V12 to form [V12O32(CH2NO2)]5- (V12(CH2NO2)). A crystallographic analysis revealed the double-bond characteristic short bond distance of 1.248 Å between the carbon and nitrogen atoms in the nitromethane anion in V12. 1H and 13C NMR studies showed that the nitromethane anion in V12 must not be exchanged with the nitromethane solvent. Thus, the V12 container restrains the reactivity of anionic species. "
Expression of Circulating MicroRNAs Linked to Bone Metabolism in Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder,"The pathophysiology of chronic kidney disease–mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is complex and multifactorial. Recent studies have identified a link between microRNAs (miRNAs) and bone loss. In this study, we investigated the expression of miRNAs in CKD-MBD. In this case-control study, we included thirty patients with CKD-MBD (cases) and 30 age- and gender-matched healthy individuals (controls). Bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS) evaluation was performed with dual X-ray absorptiometry. The selected panel of miRNAs included: hsa-miRNA-21-5p; hsa-miRNA-23a-3p; hsa-miRNA-24-2-5p; hsa-miRNA-26a-5p; hsa-miRNA-29a-3; hsa-miRNA-124-3p; hsa-miRNA-2861. The majority of cases had low BMD values. The relative expression of miRNA-21-5p was 15 times lower [fold regulation (FR): -14.7  8.1, p "
"Avoiding Axillary Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy after Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy in Breast Cancer: Rationale for the Prospective, Multicentric EUBREAST-01 Trial","Currently, axillary surgery for breast cancer is considered only as staging procedure, since the risk of developing metastasis depends on the biological behavior of the primary. The postsurgical therapy should be considered on the basis of biologic tumor characteristics rather than nodal involvement. Improvements in systemic treatments for breast cancer have increased the rates of pathologic complete response (pCR) in patients receiving neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST), offering the opportunity to de-escalate surgery in patients who have a pCR. European Breast Cancer Research Association of Surgical Trialists (EUBREAST)-01 is a clinical trial in which only patients with the highest likelihood of having a pCR after NAST (triple-negative or HER2-positive breast cancer) will be included and type of surgery will be defined according to the response to NAST rather than on the classical T (for tumor size in the breast) and N (for axillary lymph node involvement) status. In the discussed trial, axillary surgery will be eliminated completely (no axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy) for initially clinical node-negative (cN0) patients with radiologic complete remission and a breast pCR in the lumpectomy specimen. The trial design is a multicenter single-arm study with a limited number of patients (n "

Asthma-Like Features and Anti-Asthmatic Drug Prescription in Children with Non-CF Bronchiectasis,"Bronchiectasis and asthma may share some characteristics and some patients may have both conditions. The present study aimed to examine the rationale of prophylactic inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) prescription in children with bronchiectasis. Data of children with radiologically established bronchiectasis were retrospectively reviewed. Episodes of dyspnea and wheezing, spirometric indices, total serum IgE, blood eosinophil counts, sensitization to aeroallergens, and air-trapping on expiratory CT scans, were recorded. The study included 65 children 1.5–16 years old, with non-CF bronchiectasis. Episodes of dyspnea or wheezing were reported by 22 (33.8%) and 23 (35.4%), respectively. Skin prick tests to aeroallergens (SPTs) were positive in 15 (23.0%) patients. Mosaic pattern on CT scans was observed in 37 (56.9%) patients. Dyspnea, presence of mosaic pattern, positive reversibility test, and positive SPTs were significantly correlated with the prescription of ICS. The prescription of ICS in children with bronchiectasis is more likely when there are certain asthma-like characteristics. The difficulty to set the diagnosis of real asthma in cases of bronchiectasis may justify the decision of clinicians to start an empirical trial with ICS in certain cases. "

Transcriptome Analyses Reveal Differential Transcriptional Profiles in Early- and Late-Dividing Porcine Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer Embryos,"Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is not only a valuable tool for understanding nuclear reprogramming, but it also facilitates the generation of genetically modified animals. However, the development of SCNT embryos has remained an uncontrollable process. It was reported that the SCNT embryos that complete the first cell division sooner are more likely to develop to the blastocyst stage, suggesting their better developmental competence. Therefore, to better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, RNA-seq of pig SCNT embryos that were early-dividing (24 h postactivation) and late-dividing (36 h postactivation) was performed. Our analysis revealed that early- and late-dividing embryos have distinct RNA profiles, and, in all, 3077 genes were differentially expressed. Gene ontology (GO)and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses revealed that early-dividing embryos exhibited higher expression in genes that participated in the meiotic cell cycle, while enrichment of RNA processing- and translation-related genes was found in late-dividing embryos. There are also fewer somatic memory genes such as FLRT2, ADAMTS1, and FOXR1, which are abnormally activated or suppressed in early-dividing cloned embryos. These results show that early-dividing SCNT embryos have different transcriptional profiles than late-dividing embryos. Early division of SCNT embryos may be associated with their better reprogramming capacity, and somatic memory genes may act as a reprogramming barrier in pig SCNT reprogramming. "
Treatment of Anti-HLA Donor-Specific Antibodies Results in Increased Infectious Complications and Impairs Survival after Liver Transplantation,"Donor-specific anti-human leukocyte antigen antibodies (DSA) are controversially discussed in the context of liver transplantation (LT). We investigated the relationship between the presence of DSA and the outcome after LT. All the LTs performed at our center between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2015 were examined. Recipients < 18 years, living donor-, combined, high-urgency-, and re-transplantations were excluded. Out of 510 LTs, 113 DSA-positive cases were propensity score-matched with DSA-negative cases based on the components of the Balance of Risk score. One-, three-, and five-year survival after LT were 74.3% in DSA-positive vs. 84.8% (p "
Complete Extraction of Amorphous Aluminosilicate from Coal Fly Ash by Alkali Leaching under Atmospheric Pressure,"One of the potential sources of alumina and mesoporous silica is the coal-fired thermal plants waste known as the coal fly ash (CFA). The studies of the alumina extraction from CFA are often focused on the preliminary desilication, but the efficiency of the alkali desilication is low due to formation of the desilication product—Na6[Al6Si6O24]Na2X (DSP). This research is focused on the possibility of CFA desilication without formation of DSP using a leaching process with higher liquid to solid ratios (L/S) and alkali concentrations. The experimental data were analyzed using an artificial neural network (ANN) machine learning method and a shrinking core model (SCM). The investigation of the CFA morphology, chemical and phase composition before and after leaching were carried out by scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The present work shows that it is possible to avoid formation of DSP if using the L/S ratio >20 and concentration of Na2O—400 g/L during CFA leaching. The kinetics analysis by SCM showed that the process is limited by the surface chemical reaction at T <100 C, and by diffusion through the product layer at T >100 C, respectively. The SEM images of the solid residue after NaOH leaching under conditions that prevent the DSP formation show mullite particles with an acicular structure. "

Reliability Optimization of a Railway Network,"With the increase of the railway operating mileage, the railway network is becoming more and more complicated. We expect to build more railway lines to offer the possibility to offer more high quality service for the passengers, while the investment is often limited. Therefore, it is very important to decide the pairs of cities to add new railway lines under the condition of limited construction investment in order to optimize the railway line network to maximize the reliability of the railway network to deal with the railway passenger transport task under emergency conditions. In this paper, we firstly define the reliability of the railway networks based on probability theory by analyzing three minor cases. Then we construct a reliability optimization model for the railway network to solve the problem, expecting to enhance the railway network with the limited investment. The goal is to make an optimal decision when choosing where to add new railway lines to maximize the reliability of the whole railway network, taking the construction investment as the main constraint, which is turned to the building mileage limit. A computing case is presented based on the railway network of Shandong Province, China. The computing results prove the effectiveness of the model and the efficiency of the algorithm. The approach presented in this paper can provide a reference for the railway investors and builders to make an optimal decision. "
The Potential Role of Power-to-Gas Technology Connected to Photovoltaic Power Plants in the Visegrad Countries—A Case Study,"With the spread of the use of renewable sources of energy, weather-dependent solar energy is also coming more and more to the fore. The quantity of generated electric power changes proportionally to the intensity of solar radiation. Thus, a cloudy day, for example, greatly reduces the amount of electricity produced from this energy source. In the countries of the European Union solar power plants are obligated to prepare power generation forecasts broken down to 15- or 60-min intervals. The interest of the regionally responsible transmission system operators is to be provided with forecasts with the least possible deviation from the actual figures. This paper examines the Visegrad countries’ intraday photovoltaic forecasts and their deviations from real power generation based on the photovoltaic power capacity monitored by the transmission system operators in each country. The novelty of this study lies in the fact that, in the context of monitored PV capacities in the Visegrad countries, it examines the regulation capacities needed for keeping the forecasts. After comparing the needs for positive and negative regulation, the author made deductions regarding storage possibilities complementing electrochemical regulation, based on the balance. The paper sought answers concerning the technologies required for the balancing of PV power plants in the examined countries. It was established that, as a result of photovoltaic power capacity regulation, among the four Visegrad countries, only the Hungarian transmission system operator has negative required power regulation, which could be utilized in power-to-gas plants. This power could be used to produce approximately 2.1 million Nm3 biomethane with a 98% methane content, which could be used to improve approximately 4 million Nm3 biogas of poor quality by enriching it (minimum 60% methane content), so that it can be utilized. The above process could enhance the viability of 4–6 low-methane agricultural biogas plants in Hungary. "

Impact of Adverse Drug Reactions in Patients with End Stage Renal Disease in Greece,"Background: Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) require specialized therapeutic interventions. The decreased renal function that modulates the physiology and presence of comorbidities is often associated with variations in the pharmacological response, thus increasing the risk of adverse drug events or reactions (ADE/ADRs) from co-administered drugs. Methods: A cross-sectional study to record comorbidities, drug–drug interactions (DDIs), ADE/ADRs in patients with chronic kidney disease of stage five in Greece. The study enrolled 60 patients of mean age 64.8  12.9 years, undergoing hemodialysis three times a week. Demographic and social factors, comorbidities, laboratory test data, medication regimens, DDIs and the reporting of ADE/ADRs were analyzed. Results: Cardiovascular diseases and diabetes were the main comorbidities. In total, 50 different DDIs of various clinical significance were identified. CNS, GI-track, and musculoskeletal-system-related ADE/ADRs were most often reported by patients. ADE/ADRs as clinical outcome from DDIs were associated in 64% of the total identified DDIs. There was a positive trend between number of medications, ADE/ADRs report and DDIs. Conclusions: The impact of ADE/ADRs in ESRD patients should be always considered. Guidelines as well as continuous training in the context of evidence-based clinical practice by healthcare personnel on therapy administration and prevention of adverse events are important. "
"The Impact of the Method Extraction and Different Carrot Variety on the Carotenoid Profile, Total Phenolic Content and Antioxidant Properties of Juices","The study assesses the antioxidant activity (AA), carotenoid profile and total phenolic content (TPC) of carrot juices obtained from three different varieties (black, orange and yellow) and prepared using high- (HSJ) and low-speed juicer (LSJ). The AA assessment was carried out using four assays (DPPH, ABTS, PCL ACW and PCL ACL). The content of carotenoids was conducted by high performance liquid chromatography equipped with a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) method, while the total phenolic content by the spectrophotometric method. It was shown that orange carrot juices contain more carotenoids than yellow and black carrot juices, approximately ten and three times more, respectively. The total carotenoid content in orange carrot juice made by the HSJ was higher (by over 11%) compared to juice prepared by the LSJ. The highest total phenolic content was noticed in black carrot juices, while the lowest in orange carrot juices. In black carrot juices, a higher range of TPC was found in juices made by HSJ, while in the case of the orange and yellow carrots, the highest content of TPC was detected in juices prepared by the LSJ. AA of the juices was highly dependent on the carrot variety, juice extraction method. The most assays confirmed the highest AA values in black carrot juices. Furthermore, it was shown that the HSJ method is more preferred to obtain orange and yellow carrot juices with higher antioxidant properties, while the LSJ method is more suitable for black carrot juice extraction.

"Setup, Test and Validation of a UHF RFID System for Monitoring Feeding Behaviour of Dairy Cows","Feeding behaviour can be used as an important indicator to support animal management. However, using feeding behaviour as a tool for dairy cow management an automatic sensor system is needed. Hence, the objective of this study was to setup, test and validate a ultra-high frequency (UHF) radio-frequency identification (RFID) system for measuring time dairy cows spent at the feed fence using two types of passive UHF ear tags. In a first experiment, the reading area of the system was evaluated in two antenna positions. Subsequently, the UHF RFID system was validated with video observations and compared to the measurements of chewing time of a noseband pressure sensor and of the time spent at the feed fence registered by a sensor system with real-time localisation. Differences in the reading area were detected between the two antenna positions and types of ear tag. The antenna position leading to less false positive registrations was chosen for the experiment with cows. The validation with video data showed a high average sensitivity (93.7  5.6%, mean  standard deviation), specificity (97.8  1.1%), precision (93.8  2.3%) and accuracy (96.9  0.9%) of the UHF RFID system for measuring the time spent at the feed fence. The comparison with the noseband pressure sensor and the real-time localisation resulted in high correlations with a correlation coefficient of r "
Betulinic Acid Ameliorates the T-2 Toxin-Triggered Intestinal Impairment in Mice by Inhibiting Inflammation and Mucosal Barrier Dysfunction through the NF-B Signaling Pathway,"T-2 toxin, a trichothecene mycotoxin produced by Fusarium, is widely distributed in crops and animal feed and frequently induces intestinal damage. Betulinic acid (BA), a plant-derived pentacyclic lupane-type triterpene, possesses potential immunomodulatory, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory biological properties. The current study aimed to explore the protective effect and molecular mechanisms of BA on intestinal mucosal impairment provoked by acute exposure to T-2 toxin. Mice were intragastrically administered BA (0.25, 0.5, or 1 mg/kg) daily for 2 weeks and then injected intraperitoneally with T-2 toxin (4 mg/kg) once to induce an intestinal impairment. BA pretreatment inhibited the loss of antioxidant capacity in the intestine of T-2 toxin-treated mice by elevating the levels of CAT, GSH-PX and GSH and reducing the accumulation of MDA. In addition, BA pretreatment alleviated the T-2 toxin-triggered intestinal immune barrier dysregulation by increasing the SIgA level in the intestine at dosages of 0.5 and 1 mg/kg, increasing IgG and IgM levels in serum at dosages of 0.5 and 1 mg/kg and restoring the intestinal C3 and C4 levels at a dosage of 1 mg/kg. BA administration at a dosage of 1 mg/kg also improved the intestinal chemical barrier by decreasing the serum level of DAO. Moreover, BA pretreatment improved the intestinal physical barrier via boosting the expression of ZO-1 and Occludin mRNAs and restoring the morphology of intestinal villi that was altered by T-2 toxin. Furthermore, treatment with 1 mg/kg BA downregulated the expression of p-NF-B and p-IB- proteins in the intestine, while all doses of BA suppressed the pro-inflammatory cytokines expression of IL-1, IL-6 and TNF- mRNAs and increased the anti-inflammatory cytokine expression of IL-10 mRNA in the intestine of T-2 toxin-exposed mice. BA was proposed to exert a protective effect on intestinal mucosal disruption in T-2 toxin-stimulated mice by enhancing the intestinal antioxidant capacity, inhibiting the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and repairing intestinal mucosal barrier functions, which may be associated with BA-mediated inhibition of the NF-B signaling pathway activation.

Assessing the Prevalence and Association of Pulp Stones with Cardiovascular Diseases and Diabetes Mellitus in the Saudi Arabian Population—A CBCT Based Study,"The detection of pulp stone in a patient suffering from undiagnosed systemic diseases can be an early diagnostic indicator. Thus, the aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of pulp stones in the Saudi Arabian population with cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus. In a retrospective study, we included cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans of 73 patients with cardiovascular disease and 76 patients with diabetes mellitus as group I and II, respectively. Group III comprised of CBCT scan of 80 healthy controls. From a total of 229 scans, 4807 teeth were screened for pulp stones throughout the arches. A chi-square test was used for comparing the prevalence of pulp stones among the groups. Univariable and multivariable analysis was done to evaluate the independent risk indicators for pulp stones. The tooth-wise prevalence of pulp stones in group I, II, and III was found to be 16.65%, 9.01%, and 3.86%, respectively. Patient-wise (p < 0.01) and tooth-wise (p < 0.01) prevalence was recorded significantly highest in the cardiovascular group followed by the diabetic group. The control group had the least prevalence. Significantly (p < 0.01) higher number of pulp stones were found in cardiovascular patients with age > 50 years compared to other groups. Similarly, a significantly increased number of pulp stones were seen in the 1st molar (p < 0.05) and the maxillary jaw (p < 0.05) of patients with cardiovascular diseases. Subjects with cardiovascular disease and diabetes were found to have 2.94 times (p < 0.001; CI 1.54–3.10) and 1.81 times (p < 0.01; CI 0.48–2.06) higher risk of having pulp stones in comparison to healthy subjects. The first molar has 2.20 times (p < 0.001; CI 0.84–2.45) increased the risk of having pulp stones compared to other tooth types. Systemic disease such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus poses a higher risk for the development of pulp stones. Among the systemic disease group, patients in the cardiovascular group showed a higher risk for pulp stones and also reported the maximum number of pulp stones compared to the diabetic and healthy subjects.

Multimorbidity Patterns and Unplanned Hospitalisation in a Cohort of Older Adults,"The presence of multiple chronic conditions (i.e., multimorbidity) increases the risk of hospitalisation in older adults. We aimed to examine the association between different multimorbidity patterns and unplanned hospitalisations over 5 years. To that end, 2,250 community-dwelling individuals aged 60 years and older from the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K) were studied. Participants were grouped into six multimorbidity patterns using a fuzzy c-means cluster analysis. The associations between patterns and outcomes were tested using Cox models and negative binomial models. After 5 years, 937 (41.6%) participants experienced at least one unplanned hospitalisation. Compared to participants in the unspecific multimorbidity pattern, those in the cardiovascular diseases, anaemia and dementia pattern, the psychiatric disorders pattern and the metabolic and sleep disorders pattern presented with a higher hazard of first unplanned hospitalisation (hazard ratio range: 1.49–2.05; p < 0.05 for all), number of unplanned hospitalisations (incidence rate ratio (IRR) range: 1.89–2.44; p < 0.05 for all), in-hospital days (IRR range: 1.91–3.61; p < 0.05 for all), and 30-day unplanned readmissions (IRR range: 2.94–3.65; p < 0.05 for all). Different multimorbidity patterns displayed a differential association with unplanned hospital care utilisation. These findings call for a careful primary care follow-up of older adults with complex multimorbidity patterns. "
The Providence Mutation (K82D) in Human Hemoglobin Substantially Reduces Cysteine 93 Oxidation and Oxidative Stress in Endothelial Cells,"The highly toxic oxidative transformation of hemoglobin (Hb) to the ferryl state (HbFe4+) is known to occur in both in vitro and in vivo settings. We recently constructed oxidatively stable human Hbs, based on the Hb Providence (K82D) mutation in sickle cell Hb (E6V/K82D) and in a recombinant crosslinked Hb (rHb0.1/K82D). Using High Resolution Accurate Mass (HRAM) mass spectrometry, we first quantified the degree of irreversible oxidation of Cys93 in these proteins, induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and compared it to their respective controls (HbA and HbS). Both Hbs containing the K82D mutation showed considerably less cysteic acid formation, a byproduct of cysteine irreversible oxidation. Next, we performed a novel study aimed at exploring the impact of introducing K82D containing Hbs on vascular endothelial redox homeostasis and energy metabolism. Incubation of the mutants carrying K82D with endothelial cells resulted in altered bioenergetic function, by improving basal cellular glycolysis and glycolytic capacity. Treatment of cells with Hb variants containing K82D resulted in lower heme oxygenase-1 and ferritin expressions, compared to native Hbs. We conclude that the presence of K82D confers oxidative stability to Hb and adds significant resistance to oxidative toxicity. Therefore, we propose that K82D is a potential gene-editing target in the treatment of sickle cell disease and in the design of safe and effective oxygen therapeutics. "
CoMnO2-Decorated Polyimide-Based Carbon Fiber Electrodes for Wire-Type Asymmetric Supercapacitor Applications,"In this work, we report the carbon fiber-based wire-type asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs). The highly conductive carbon fibers were prepared by the carbonized and graphitized process using the polyimide (PI) as a carbon fiber precursor. To assemble the ASC device, the CoMnO2-coated and Fe2O3-coated carbon fibers were used as the cathode and the anode materials, respectively. Herein, the nanostructured CoMnO2 were directly deposited onto carbon fibers by a chemical oxidation route without high temperature treatment in presence of ammonium persulfate (APS) as an oxidizing agent. FE-SEM analysis confirmed that the CoMnO2-coated carbon fiber electrode exhibited the porous hierarchical interconnected nanosheet structures, depending on the added amount of APS, and Fe2O3-coated carbon fiber electrode showed a uniform distribution of porous Fe2O3 nanorods over the surface of carbon fibers. The electrochemical properties of the CoMnO2-coated carbon fiber with the concentration of 6 mmol APS presented the enhanced electrochemical activity, probably due to its porous morphologies and good conductivity. Further, to reduce the interfacial contact resistance as well as improve the adhesion between transition metal nanostructures and carbon fibers, the carbon fibers were pre-coated with the Ni layer as a seed layer using an electrochemical deposition method. The fabricated ASC device delivered a specific capacitance of 221 F g-1 at 0.7 A g-1 and good rate capability of 34.8% at 4.9 A g-1. Moreover, the wire-type device displayed the superior energy density of 60.2 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 490 W kg-1 and excellent capacitance retention of 95% up to 3000 charge/discharge cycles. "
Elevated Production of Mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species via Hyperthermia Enhanced Cytotoxic Effect of Doxorubicin in Human Breast Cancer Cell Lines MDA-MB-453 and MCF-7,"Hyperthermia (HT) treatment is a noninvasive cancer therapy, often used with radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Compared with 37 C, 42 C is mild heat stress for cells and produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) from mitochondria. To involve subsequent intracellular accumulation of DOX, we have previously reported that the expression of ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2), an exporter of doxorubicin (DOX), was suppressed by a larger amount of intracellular mitochondrial ROS. We then hypothesized that the additive effect of HT and chemotherapy would be induced by the downregulation of ABCG2 expression via intracellular ROS increase. We used human breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453, incubated at 37 C or 42 C for 1 h to clarify this hypothesis. Intracellular ROS production after HT was detected via electron spin resonance (ESR), and DOX cytotoxicity was calculated. Additionally, ABCG2 expression in whole cells was analyzed using Western blotting. We confirmed that the ESR signal peak with HT became higher than that without HT, indicating that the intracellular ROS level was increased by HT. ABCG2 expression was downregulated by HT, and cells were injured after DOX treatment. DOX cytotoxicity enhancement with HT was considered a result of ABCG2 expression downregulation via the increase of ROS production. HT increased intracellular ROS production and downregulated ABCG2 protein expression, leading to cell damage enhancement via DOX. "

Coupling Hydrothermal Carbonization with Anaerobic Digestion for Sewage Sludge Treatment: Influence of HTC Liquor and Hydrochar on Biomethane Production,"The present study addresses the coupling of hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) with anaerobic digestion (AD) in wastewater treatment plants. The improvement in biomethane production due to the recycling back to the anaerobic digester of HTC liquor and hydrochar generated from digested sludge is investigated and proved. Mixtures of different compositions of HTC liquor and hydrochar, as well as individual substrates, were tested. The biomethane yield reached 102  3 mL CH4 g-1 COD when the HTC liquor was cycled back to the AD and treated together with primary and secondary sludge. Thus, the biomethane production was almost doubled compared to that of the AD of primary and secondary sludge (55  20 mL CH4 g-1 COD). The benefit is even more significant when both the HTC liquor and the hydrochar were fed to the AD of primary and secondary sludge. The biomethane yield increased up to 187  18 mL CH4 g-1 COD when 45% of hydrochar, with respect to the total feedstock, was added. These results highlight the improvement that the HTC process can bring to AD, enhancing biomethane production and promoting a sustainable solution for the treatment of the HTC liquor and possibly the hydrochar itself.

"Toll-Like Receptor 2 at the Crossroad between Cancer Cells, the Immune System, and the Microbiota","Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) expressed on myeloid cells mediates the recognition of harmful molecules belonging to invading pathogens or host damaged tissues, leading to inflammation. For this ability to activate immune responses, TLR2 has been considered a player in anti-cancer immunity. Therefore, TLR2 agonists have been used as adjuvants for anti-cancer immunotherapies. However, TLR2 is also expressed on neoplastic cells from different malignancies and promotes their proliferation through activation of the myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88)/nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell (NF-B) pathway. Furthermore, its activation on regulatory immune cells may contribute to the generation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment and of the pre-metastatic niche, promoting cancer progression. Thus, TLR2 represents a double-edge sword, whose role in cancer needs to be carefully understood for the setup of effective therapies. In this review, we discuss the divergent effects induced by TLR2 activation in different immune cell populations, cancer cells, and cancer stem cells. Moreover, we analyze the stimuli that lead to its activation in the tumor microenvironment, addressing the role of danger, pathogen, and microbiota-associated molecular patterns and their modulation during cancer treatments. This information will contribute to the scientific debate on the use of TLR2 agonists or antagonists in cancer treatment and pave the way for new therapeutic avenues. "
High Mobility Group Box-1 and Blood–Brain Barrier Disruption,"Increasing evidence suggests that inflammatory responses are involved in the progression of brain injuries induced by a diverse range of insults, including ischemia, hemorrhage, trauma, epilepsy, and degenerative diseases. During the processes of inflammation, disruption of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) may play a critical role in the enhancement of inflammatory responses and may initiate brain damage because the BBB constitutes an interface between the brain parenchyma and the bloodstream containing blood cells and plasma. The BBB has a distinct structure compared with those in peripheral tissues: it is composed of vascular endothelial cells with tight junctions, numerous pericytes surrounding endothelial cells, astrocytic endfeet, and a basement membrane structure. Under physiological conditions, the BBB should function as an important element in the neurovascular unit (NVU). High mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), a nonhistone nuclear protein, is ubiquitously expressed in almost all kinds of cells. HMGB1 plays important roles in the maintenance of chromatin structure, the regulation of transcription activity, and DNA repair in nuclei. On the other hand, HMGB1 is considered to be a representative damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) because it is translocated and released extracellularly from different types of brain cells, including neurons and glia, contributing to the pathophysiology of many diseases in the central nervous system (CNS). The regulation of HMGB1 release or the neutralization of extracellular HMGB1 produces beneficial effects on brain injuries induced by ischemia, hemorrhage, trauma, epilepsy, and Alzheimer’s amyloidpathy in animal models and is associated with improvement of the neurological symptoms. In the present review, we focus on the dynamics of HMGB1 translocation in different disease conditions in the CNS and discuss the functional roles of extracellular HMGB1 in BBB disruption and brain inflammation. There might be common as well as distinct inflammatory processes for each CNS disease. This review will provide novel insights toward an improved understanding of a common pathophysiological process of CNS diseases, namely, BBB disruption mediated by HMGB1. It is proposed that HMGB1 might be an excellent target for the treatment of CNS diseases with BBB disruption. "
Establishment and Preliminary Characterization of Three Astrocytic Cells Lines Obtained from Primary Rat Astrocytes by Sub-Cloning,"Gliomas are complex and heterogeneous tumors that originate from the glial cells of the brain. The malignant cells undergo deep modifications of their metabolism, and acquire the capacity to invade the brain parenchyma and to induce epigenetic modifications in the other brain cell types. In spite of the efforts made to define the pathology at the molecular level, and to set novel approaches to reach the infiltrating cells, gliomas are still fatal. In order to gain a better knowledge of the cellular events that accompany astrocyte transformation, we developed three increasingly transformed astrocyte cell lines, starting from primary rat cortical astrocytes, and analyzed them at the cytogenetic and epigenetic level. In parallel, we also studied the expression of the differentiation-related H1.0 linker histone variant to evaluate its possible modification in relation with transformation. We found that the most modified astrocytes (A-FC6) have epigenetic and chromosomal alterations typical of cancer, and that the other two clones (A-GS1 and A-VV5) have intermediate properties. Surprisingly, the differentiation-specific somatic histone H1.0 steadily increases from the normal astrocytes to the most transformed ones. As a whole, our results suggest that these three cell lines, together with the starting primary cells, constitute a potential model for studying glioma development. "

Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) Haplotype Does Not Influence the Inflammatory Pattern of Duodenal Lymphocytosis Linked to Irritable Bowel Syndrome,"Background and objectives: Duodenal lymphocytosis (DL) is a condition characterized by enhanced infiltration of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) in the duodenal mucosa, and it can be linked to both gluten- and non-gluten-related diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Materials and methods: We retrospectively selected patients with DL linked to IBS. Formalin-embedded biopsy samples of the duodenum were collected. CD3 lymphocyte immunohistochemistry was used for IELs. The real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the amount of mRNA coding for tissue transglutaminase 2 (tTG2), interferon-gamma (IFN), toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), and myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88). All subjects underwent DQ2-8 haplotype analysis. Controls were represented by subjects with IBS without DL. Results: Thirty-two patients with IBS-DL were retrospectively recruited. Fourteen subjects (43.8%) had a DQ2-8 haplotype. DQ2-8 positive subjects had similar levels compared to negative ones for tTG2, IFN, TLR2, and MyD88. Cigarette smoke did not influence molecular expression in our study. Smokers had a statistically higher IELs count than non-smokers (54.2  7.7 vs. 36.0  8.8, p < 0.001). A significant, direct correlation between IELs and duodenal expression of IFN was found (r "
Comprehensive Analysis of SWI/SNF Inactivation in Lung Adenocarcinoma Cell Models,"Mammalian SWI/SNF (SWitch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable) complexes are ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers whose subunits have emerged among the most frequently mutated genes in cancer. Studying SWI/SNF function in cancer cell line models has unveiled vulnerabilities in SWI/SNF-mutant tumors that can lead to the discovery of new therapeutic drugs. However, choosing an appropriate cancer cell line model for SWI/SNF functional studies can be challenging because SWI/SNF subunits are frequently altered in cancer by various mechanisms, including genetic alterations and post-transcriptional mechanisms. In this work, we combined genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic approaches to study the mutational status and the expression levels of the SWI/SNF subunits in a panel of 38 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cell lines. We found that the SWI/SNF complex was mutated in more than 76% of our LUAD cell lines and there was a high variability in the expression of the different SWI/SNF subunits. These results underline the importance of the SWI/SNF complex as a tumor suppressor in LUAD and the difficulties in defining altered and unaltered cell models for the SWI/SNF complex. These findings will assist researchers in choosing the most suitable cellular models for their studies of SWI/SNF to bring all of its potential to the development of novel therapeutic applications. "

Exposure to Aerosolized Algal Toxins in South Florida Increases Short- and Long-Term Health Risk in Drosophila Model of Aging,"Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are a rising health and environmental concern in the United States, particularly in South Florida. Skin contact and the ingestion of contaminated water or fish and other seafood have been proven to have severe toxicity to humans in some cases. However, the impact of aerosolized HAB toxins is poorly understood. In particular, knowledge regarding either the immediate or long-term effects of exposure to aerosolized cyanotoxins produced by freshwater blue-green algae does not exist. The aim of this study was to probe the toxicity of aerosolized cyanobacterial blooms using Drosophila melanogaster as an animal model. The exposure of aerosolized HABs at an early age leads to the most severe long-term impact on health and longevity among all age groups. Young groups and old males showed a strong acute response to HAB exposure. In addition, brain morphological analysis using fluorescence imaging reveals significant indications of brain degeneration in females exposed to aerosolized HABs in early or late stages. These results indicate that one-time exposure to aerosolized HAB particles causes a significant health risk, both immediately and in the long-term. Interestingly, age at the time of exposure plays an important role in the specific nature of the impact of aerosol HABs. As BMAA and microcystin have been found to be the significant toxins in cyanobacteria, the concentration of both toxins in the water and aerosols was examined. BMAA and microcystin are consistently detected in HAB waters, although their concentrations do not always correlate with the severity of the health impact, suggesting the potential contribution from additional toxins present in the aerosolized HAB. This study demonstrates, for the first time, the health risk of exposure to aerosolized HAB, and further highlights the critical need and importance of understanding the toxicity of aerosolized cyanobacteria HAB particles and determining the immediate and long-term health impacts of HAB exposure.

Porous Film Coating Enabled by Polyvinyl Pyrrolidone (PVP) for Enhanced Air Permeability of Fabrics: The Effect of PVP Molecule Weight and Dosage,"This study developed a versatile and facile method for creating pores and tuning the porous structure in the polymer latex films by selectively etching the added functional polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) molecules. The pore formed in the latex films had a similar morphology to that of PVP aggregation before etching. This observation promotes us to regulate the pore morphology that determines the film’s property, such as air permeability through varying the PVP molecule weight and dosage. To this end, the effects of PVP molecule weight and dosage on the pore formation were systematically studied. The results showed that the average pore size of porous film decreased from >10 m to sub-micron (about 0.4 m) as the molecular weight or the dosage of PVP increased. This was ascribed to the strong adsorption affinity of PVP molecule onto the latex particle surface, which further hindered the diffusion and self-assembly of PVP molecule. In addition, this interaction became much stronger when the higher molecule weight of PVP or the higher dosage of PVP was employed, leading to the decreased size of PVP aggregation, as well as the formed pores in the latex films. Furthermore, the addition of PVP had little effect on the color of coated fabric based on the results of CIE L*a*b* measurement. The proposed facile method can be used to improve the air permeability of coated fabrics. "
Interrupting Neuron—Tumor Interactions to Overcome Treatment Resistance,"Neurons in the tumor microenvironment release neurotransmitters, neuroligins, chemokines, soluble growth factors, and membrane-bound growth factors that solid tumors leverage to drive their own survival and spread. Tumors express nerve-specific growth factors and microRNAs that support local neurons and guide neuronal growth into tumors. The development of feed-forward relationships between tumors and neurons allows tumors to use the perineural space as a sanctuary from therapy. Tumor denervation slows tumor growth in animal models, demonstrating the innervation dependence of growing tumors. Further in vitro and in vivo experiments have identified many of the secreted signaling molecules (e.g., acetylcholine, nerve growth factor) that are passed between neurons and cancer cells, as well as the major signaling pathways (e.g., MAPK/EGFR) involved in these trophic interactions. The molecules involved in these signaling pathways serve as potential biomarkers of disease. Additionally, new treatment strategies focus on using small molecules, receptor agonists, nerve-specific toxins, and surgical interventions to target tumors, neurons, and immune cells of the tumor microenvironment, thereby severing the interactions between tumors and surrounding neurons. This article discusses the mechanisms underlying the trophic relationships formed between neurons and tumors and explores the emerging therapies stemming from this work. "

The Optimization of a Novel Hydrogel—Egg White-Alginate for 2.5D Tissue Engineering of Salivary Spheroid-Like Structure,"Hydrogels have been used for a variety of biomedical applications; in tissue engineering, they are commonly used as scaffolds to cultivate cells in a three-dimensional (3D) environment allowing the formation of organoids or cellular spheroids. Egg white-alginate (EWA) is a novel hydrogel which combines the advantages of both egg white and alginate; the egg white material provides extracellular matrix (ECM)-like proteins that can mimic the ECM microenvironment, while alginate can be tuned mechanically through its ionic crosslinking property to modify the scaffold’s porosity, strength, and stiffness. In this study, a frozen calcium chloride (CaCl2) disk technique to homogenously crosslink alginate and egg white hydrogel is presented for 2.5D culture of human salivary cells. Different EWA formulations were prepared and biologically evaluated as a spheroid-like structure platform. Although all five EWA hydrogels showed biocompatibility, the EWA with 1.5% alginate presented the highest cell viability, while EWA with 3% alginate promoted the formation of larger size salivary spheroid-like structures. Our EWA hydrogel has the potential to be an alternative 3D culture scaffold that can be used for studies on drug-screening, cell migration, or as an in vitro disease model. In addition, EWA can be used as a potential source for cell transplantation (i.e., using this platform as an ex vivo environment for cell expansion). The low cost of producing EWA is an added advantage. "
The Links between Microbiome and Uremic Toxins in Acute Kidney Injury: Beyond Gut Feeling—A Systematic Review,"The last years have brought an abundance of data on the existence of a gut-kidney axis and the importance of microbiome in kidney injury. Data on kidney-gut crosstalk suggest the possibility that microbiota alter renal inflammation; we therefore aimed to answer questions about the role of microbiome and gut-derived toxins in acute kidney injury. PubMed and Cochrane Library were searched from inception to October 10, 2020 for relevant studies with an additional search performed on ClinicalTrials.gov. We identified 33 eligible articles and one ongoing trial (21 original studies and 12 reviews/commentaries), which were included in this systematic review. Experimental studies prove the existence of a kidney-gut axis, focusing on the role of gut-derived uremic toxins and providing concepts that modification of the microbiota composition may result in better AKI outcomes. Small interventional studies in animal models and in humans show promising results, therefore, microbiome-targeted therapy for AKI treatment might be a promising possibility. "
Post-Mortem Diagnosis and Autopsy Findings in SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Forensic Case Series,"Towards the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the culprit for a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. Since then, it has rapidly spread worldwide, affecting more than 43 million people, and in March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic. The purpose of the study is to present the findings of 15 forensic autopsies performed in Romania, on SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) positive subjects, and to present the case of one SARS-CoV-2 infected patient who experienced a violent death, as established during their autopsy. A total of 11 male and 4 female patients were autopsied, and SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed post-mortem in two cases. The most frequent symptoms before death were dry cough, dyspnoea, and fever. Hypertension, ischemic cardiac disease, and a history of stroke were the most frequent associated diseases. The mean duration from the symptoms’ debut to a RT-PCR positive SARS-CoV-2 test was 3.7 days, while the mean survival time from the RT-PCR positive test was 4.2 days. A histological examination was performed in seven cases and revealed, in most of them, hyaline membranes, and mixed inflammatory cell infiltration of the interstitium, alveoli, and perivascular areas. In addition, all of the examined cases developed small vessel thrombosis. A case of violent death was also reported, regarding a 87-year-old male subject who suffered a femur fracture (domestic fall) and was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection the following day after surgery. After transfer to a COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-19) support hospital, during an episode of behavioral disorder, the patient jumped from the first floor window. Death occurred a few days later, and the cause was established as bronchopneumonia superimposed on SARS-CoV-2 infection. In conclusion, autopsies should be conducted while providing a safe environment for professionals to perform them, because they are crucial procedures that can help gain a better understanding of the role of SARS-CoV-2 infection in thanatogenesis.

Determination of Neonicotinoid Pesticides in Propolis with Liquid Chromatography Coupled to Tandem Mass Spectrometry,"In this study, a method was developed for the determination of five neonicotinoid pesticides (acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam) in propolis. Two sample preparation methods were tested: solid-phase extraction and the quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) method. The identities of analytes were confirmed using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in the selected reaction monitoring mode. Solid-phase extraction resulted in cleaner extracts; therefore, the SPE-LC-MS/MS method was validated according to the SANTE protocol in triplicate at two spiking levels (10 ng/g and 50 ng/g). The average recoveries of analytes ranged from 61% to 101%, except for clothianidin (10–20%). The LOD ranged from 0.2 ng/g to 4.4 ng/g, whereas the LOQ was in the range of 0.8 ng/g–14.7 ng/g. In order to compensate for the matrix effect, matrix-matched calibration was used. Good accuracy (relative error: 1.9–10.4%) and good linearity (R2 > 0.991) were obtained for all compounds. The optimised method was applied to 30 samples: 18 raw propolis and 12 ethanol tinctures. Acetamiprid, imidacloprid, and thiacloprid were detectable in seven samples but were still below the LOQ. This study is the first to report the determination of several neonicotinoid residues in propolis. "
Effects of Phosphate Shortage on Root Growth and Hormone Content of Barley Depend on Capacity of the Roots to Accumulate ABA,"Although changes in root architecture in response to the environment can optimize mineral and water nutrient uptake, mechanisms regulating these changes are not well-understood. We investigated whether P deprivation effects on root development are mediated by abscisic acid (ABA) and its interactions with other hormones. The ABA-deficient barley mutant Az34 and its wild-type (WT) were grown in P-deprived and P-replete conditions, and hormones were measured in whole roots and root tips. Although P deprivation decreased growth in shoot mass similarly in both genotypes, only the WT increased primary root length and number of lateral roots. The effect was accompanied by ABA accumulation in root tips, a response not seen in Az34. Increased ABA in P-deprived WT was accompanied by decreased concentrations of cytokinin, an inhibitor of root extension. Furthermore, P-deficiency in the WT increased auxin concentration in whole root systems in association with increased root branching. In the ABA-deficient mutant, P-starvation failed to stimulate root elongation or promote branching, and there was no decline in cytokinin and no increase in auxin. The results demonstrate ABA’s ability to mediate in root growth responses to P starvation in barley, an effect linked to its effects on cytokinin and auxin concentrations. "
Accelerated Spatial Fibrin Growth and Impaired Contraction of Blood Clots in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease associated with thrombotic complications. To elucidate pathogenic mechanisms, hemostatic disorders in RA were correlated with other laboratory and clinical manifestations. Hemostasis was assessed using relatively new complementary tests, the spatial growth of a plasma clot (Thrombodynamics assay), and contraction of whole blood clots. Platelet functionality was assessed with flow cytometry that quantified the expression of P-selectin and the fibrinogen-binding capacity of platelets before and after activation with a thrombin receptor-activating peptide. Parameters of fibrin clot growth and the kinetics of contraction of blood clots were significantly altered in patients with RA compared to the control group. In Thrombodynamics measurements, an increase in the clot growth rate, size, and optical density of plasma clots altogether indicated chronic hypercoagulability. The rate and extent of blood clot contraction in patients with RA was significantly reduced and associated with platelet dysfunction revealed by an impaired response to activation. Changes in the parameters of clot growth and contraction correlated with the laboratory signs of systemic inflammation, including  hyperfibrinogenemia. These results confirm the pathogenic role of hemostatic disorders in RA and support the validity of fibrin clot growth and the blood clot contraction assay as indicators of a (pro)thrombotic state. "

Trajectory/Path-Following Controller Based on Nonlinear Jerk-Level Error Dynamics,"This study proposes a novel, nonlinear trajectory/path-following controller based on jerk-level error dynamics. Therefore, at first the nonlinear acceleration-based kinematic equations of motion of a dynamic system are differentiated with respect to time to obtain a representation connecting the translation jerk with the (specific) force derivative. Furthermore, the path deviation, i.e., the difference between the planned and the actual path, is formulated as nonlinear error dynamics based on the jerk error. Combining the derived equations of motion with the nonlinear error dynamics as well as employing nonlinear dynamic inversion, a control law can be derived that provides force derivative commands, which may be commanded to an inner loop for trajectory control. This command ensures an increased smoothness and faster reaction time compared to traditional approaches based on a force directly. Furthermore, the nonlinear parts in the error dynamic are feedforward components that improve the general performance due to their physical connection with the real dynamics. The validity and performance of the proposed trajectory/path-following controller are shown in an aircraft-related application example. "
Insights into Cardiac IKs (KCNQ1/KCNE1) Channels Regulation,"The delayed rectifier potassium IKs channel is an important regulator of the duration of the ventricular action potential. Hundreds of mutations in the genes (KCNQ1 and KCNE1) encoding the IKs channel cause long QT syndrome (LQTS). LQTS is a heart disorder that can lead to severe cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. A better understanding of the IKs channel (here called the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel) properties and activities is of great importance to find the causes of LQTS and thus potentially treat LQTS. The KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel belongs to the superfamily of voltage-gated potassium channels. The KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel consists of both the pore-forming subunit KCNQ1 and the modulatory subunit KCNE1. KCNE1 regulates the function of the KCNQ1 channel in several ways. This review aims to describe the current structural and functional knowledge about the cardiac KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel. In addition, we focus on the modulation of the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel and its potential as a target therapeutic of LQTS. "
"Combination of Colistin and Azidothymidine Demonstrates Synergistic Activity against Colistin-Resistant, Carbapenem-Resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae","Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is listed as an urgent threat by the World Health Organization because of the limited therapeutic options, rapid evolution of resistance mechanisms, and worldwide dissemination. Colistin is a common backbone agent among the “last-resort” antibiotics for CRE; however, its emerging resistance among CRE has taken the present dilemma to the next level. Azidothymidine (AZT), a thymidine analog used to treat human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, has been known to possess antibacterial effects against Enterobacteriaceae. In this study, we investigated the combined effects of AZT and colistin in 40 clinical isolates of colistin-resistant, carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CCRKP). Eleven of the 40 isolates harbored Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase. The in vitro checkerboard method and in vivo nematode killing assay both revealed synergistic activity between the two agents, with fractional inhibitory concentration indexes of 0.5 in every strain. Additionally, a significantly lower hazard ratio was observed for the nematodes treated with combination therapy (0.288; p < 0.0001) compared with either AZT or colistin treatment. Toxicity testing indicated potentially low toxicity of the combination therapy. Thus, the AZT–colistin combination could be a potentially favorable therapeutic option for treating CCRKP. "
Temporal Changes in In Vivo Glutamate Signal during Demyelination and Remyelination in the Corpus Callosum: A Glutamate-Weighted Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer Imaging Study,"Background: Glutamate-weighted chemical exchange saturation transfer (GluCEST) is a useful imaging tool that can be used to detect changes in glutamate levels in vivo and could also be helpful in the diagnosis of brain myelin changes. We investigated glutamate level changes in the cerebral white matter of a rat model of cuprizone-administered demyelination and remyelination using GluCEST. Method: We used a 7 T pre-clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system. The rats were divided into the normal control (CTRL), cuprizone-administered demyelination (CPZDM), and remyelination (CPZRM) groups. GluCEST data were analyzed using the conventional magnetization transfer ratio asymmetry in the corpus callosum. Immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy analyses were also performed to investigate the myelinated axon changes in each group. Results: The quantified GluCEST signals differed significantly between the CPZDM and CTRL groups (-7.25  1.42% vs. -2.84  1.30%; p "
Theoretical Design of the Scattering-Based Sensor for Analysis of the Vehicle Tailpipe Emission,"Measurement regulations demand, among other requirements, the reduction of particulate matter emissions from diesel engines. Considering this, the establishment of a new measurement instrument for periodic emission control and detection of the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) performance after the vehicle exhaust is necessary. To fulfil these requirements, this paper proposes the design of a new, simple, low-weight layout after the vehicle tailpipe. In order to check the operation condition of the proposed sensor, different factors such as the temperature (-10 to 50 ℃ ) humidity (60%), and flow rate of the sampled emission (laminar condition) are considered. The proposed layout uses an optical particle counter as a portable instrument for real-time detection of the particle concentration after exhaust of the internal combustion engine. "
Unravelling Chemical Composition of Agave Spines: News from Agave fourcroydes Lem.,"Spines are key plant modifications developed to deal against herbivores; however, its physical structure and chemical composition have been little explored in plant species. Here, we took advantage of high-throughput chromatography to characterize chemical composition of Agave fourcroydes Lem. spines, a species traditionally used for fiber extraction. Analyses of structural carbohydrate showed that spines have lower cellulose content than leaf fibers (52 and 72%, respectively) but contain more than 2-fold the hemicellulose and 1.5-fold pectin. Xylose and galacturonic acid were enriched in spines compared to fibers. The total lignin content in spines was 1.5-fold higher than those found in fibers, with elevated levels of syringyl (S) and guaiacyl (G) subunits but similar S/G ratios within tissues. Metabolomic profiling based on accurate mass spectrometry revealed the presence of phenolic compounds including quercetin, kaempferol, (+)-catechin, and (-)-epicatechin in A. fourcroydes spines, which were also detected in situ in spines tissues and could be implicated in the color of these plants’ structures. Abundance of (+)-catechins could also explain proanthocyanidins found in spines. Agave spines may become a plant model to obtain more insights about cellulose and lignin interactions and condensed tannin deposition, which is valuable knowledge for the bioenergy industry and development of naturally dyed fibers, respectively.
